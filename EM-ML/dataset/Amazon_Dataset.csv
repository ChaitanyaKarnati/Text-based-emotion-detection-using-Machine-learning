1,"i Bought this around black friday for $60 hoping it would be awesome... it failed so hard i tried multiple different micro SD cards none of which were recognized and YES i formated them with every format i could think of ... Fat32, NTFS, Fat, Xfat... i even tried to have the tablet do it... didnt work... to make matters worse half the apps i wanted to use werent in the app store and i came to find out that it isnt linked to the normal google play store this tablet has its own app store which is missing many common apps... the main reason i bought this was to play clash of clans and i cant because it wasnt on the app store... i tried to also use aftermarket play stores to play COC but it didnt work... launched and played 1 time but didnt work or update after that... needless to say i returned it and bought a $250 samsung galaxy tab A 10.1 (2016 version) with S-pen and its WAYYYYY better... bottom line you get what you pay for... also hint the s-pen version has an extra 1 GB of ram over the non pen version... so you should get that if you can afford the extra $50...",TERRIBLE DONT BUY
1,I bought this tablet for my 4 year old daughter. Too many advertisements. I would rather pay more and not have a single ad.,Ended up returning
1,Didn't want to go to the sites amazon wanted me to.,returned item
1,"This Kindle is so overloaded with apps that I will never use. Despite what one of Best Buys' associates said, you cannot remove any of the Amazon apps. The apps take up too much of the memory. I have an I Pad and love but bought this as a backup for work. Unfortunately, it bogs down. I also don't like that Amazon wants access to too much info to set up email, so I won't use this for emails either. I will likely sell it on Craig's List for less than half of what I paid for it.",Too may preloaded useless apps
1,I liked it at first except the browser is kind of clunky. Also you can. It use all android Apps. The worst thing though was mine just stopped working in the middle of watching a movie on a long plane flight. It was fully charged. I have tried recharging and turning on etc. it is just a blank screen and off. Kind of a cool paperweight. Hope I can get my money back. Or get a new one.,Broke in 5 mos
1,"If ads dont bother you, then this may be a decent device. Purchased this for my kid and it was loaded down with so much spam, it kept loading it up making it slow and laggy. Plus the carrasoul loadout makes it hard to navigate for kids, not very kid friendly! Oh you can pay $15 to remove the ads but it wont remove them all. Buy the samsung, better everything!",Ads ads and ads
1,"not good, hate it , never buy it again, sucks. done",hate it
1,This is not a bad product. Amazon offers greats products but this tablet was missing features even for a basic tablet. The lack of google chrome compatibility made this tablet not right for me.,More ideal for a child or teen.
1,We bought this earlier on line from another vendor and it was never delivered. Best Buy was great.,product works real well.
1,Freeze frequently... No way to trouble shoot or repair it...,Very poor.
1,"I went with this tablet based on many good customer reviews, but my experience was not a good one. From the start I was on the phone every day for at least an hour with Amazon tech support for one issue or another. Most of the techs were very polite, but not all knew the product very well. At one point I asked one of them about trying to save some RAM and they kept referring me to the storage, which told me they didn't even know the difference between RAM and regular storage. The internet browser was basic and it ran very slow at times, even when all my other wifi devices ran great. Then a day would pass and I'd be trying to type an email and the keyboard would just stop working...wtf??? Come to find out it's a ""known issue"" and ""they're working on it"". After two weeks of one thing after another I got fed up and just returned it. I wanted it to work, and gave it a good run, but just not quality stuff. To me it was like Walmart trying to build their own computer when they're obviously not a computer manufacturer, neither is Amazon. If I were you I'd look at a regular Android tablet from a reputable PC manufacturer, which is exactly what I did next. I got an ASUS tablet for only a few dollars more, and it's unbelievable. 1000% better in comparison to the Amazon Fire HD8. Save yourself the aggravation and go with ASUS or some other company that is specifically in the computer business full time. Sorry Amazon, not this time!",NOT WORTH IT
1,This thing lasted not even a month before it went dead. Going to try and take it back,dead
1,"Worked great but after awhile I wouldn't unlock. After I'd enter my pin, the screen would go black. I took it to geek squad (luckily I bought the protection plan!) and told me they don't fix them they just replace them. So I got another one but that one did the exact same thing. Ended up returning that one too.",Won't unlock
1,I bought the kindle fire 8 for my husband and I to use. Neither one of us have been able to figure out how to use it. Every time we open it advertisements pop up. And we just try buttons to remove it. We cannot get it to rotate for our puzzles. Just too complicated to use and to navigate around. I will be returning it. We have an iPad and it's much easier.,Unable to use it
1,I am bring it back for an exchange. (a different make),"8"" fire 16gb tablet"
1,I brought this tablet during the Black Friday sale fast forward to Christmas when my 6 year opens it he was happy I set it up for him two days later it crashed never came back on. Blank screen. He was disappointed and so was I .,Poor quality tablet
1,horrible...just like the other 7 i have owned ONLY due to warranties,non functional!!!
1,Does not let me connect with my library. Very diapointed,App options pathetic
1,"I have only had this Amazon Fire Hd8 since December 6, 2016 and it has already quit charging.",Quit charging
1,"If adding more than one child to the account, the screen will not rotate properly for the second, third, or fourth child. Geek squad could not fix this problem, seems to be a manufacturer's issue. Also, there are too many adds. I returned this product.",Does not work well for multiple children
1,It was on a total of an hour and a half when the screen went completely dark. Would not turn on after that. The battery was fine....It just quit working all together.,1.5 hours
1,I bought this on line as a gift. The unit does not stay on and I cannot get in touch with anyone to get the unit repaired,Doesn't stay on
1,"Nothing but problems after a month. Luckily I could take it back and get a credit for the kindle to put towards an ipad. It started off working fine then after a month it started losing internet connection randomly (while the old ipad had no problems). Then it stopped charging, never got past 1%. Tried different outlets, different android chargers. Nothing. Worthless",horrible
1,"was cheap, can not run chrome stuff, returned to store.","was cheap, can not run chrome stuff, returned"
1,"I bought this to replace a 3-year old Kindle Fire 7"" HDX that I had just dropped on the floor. I sort of panicked, so after doing a couple of hours of research I picked this tablet. Just to be on the safe side I got 16 additional GB of memory. I installed a couple of games (none of them memory hogs) and a cookbook app, in addition to downloading a couple of books and dictionaries. I can honestly say this is the slowest tablet I've ever had. Just rotating the screen takes 7-10 seconds, and that's if there's only one app open. Opening a book or magazine can take half a minute, and God help you if you want to switch between a recipe and a magazine while you're cooking! Amazon is obviously more concerned about showing you constant special offers and apps than having satisfied customers. Since there are no other Fire tablets available for whatever reason (maybe they're being discontinued?) I'll be replacing it with either an iPad or a Galaxy tablet.",Couldn't possibly hate it more.
1,Prior to using the device I decided to recharge it to 100% and was shocked to find out that it takes 6 hours. Unless you have a lot of time don't buy this device.,Poor charging
1,This is not an upgrade by any means! My three year old kindle outperformed Oasis.Battery life better than a week with the lights on lowest setting Magnetic connector is poorly designed and grows weak Two pieces to keep up with; unsnaps constantly Amazon Customer Services promises it will resolved in an update,Horrible Battery Life
1,I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started. The sales representative at the store told me this is what I needed. I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help.,Terrible
1,I had to return this product as it was not compatible with things such as Facebook and Itunes... which is what I needed it for. Great if you are into books and streaming movies!,Not so good!
1,"The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!",Not impressed with the last 2 Kindles.
1,"Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK","less than 120 days, about 100 use. It is toast!"
1,Dont have option for password ask you before buying apps once you authorized as allow its done.Not as many free good apps Like apple have it,Not really statisfied with features
1,Most buyers will have a phone or other charger that will work so you probably don't need to buy this.,Do you need it
1,cheap - need to constantly make sure plugged in - slightly too small - saved some bucks there - not amazon quality,cheap - poor fit in socket
1,"If you actually paid 20 for this adapter, you're out of your mind.","Way, way, way overpriced"
1,"This is the THIRD power charger that I have HAD to buy at cost of over 30 each since my Kindle Fire purchase. Why can't the chargers last a REASONABLE amount of time When I connected this charger, I received a message saying that it was a LOW level charger it probably would not charge while the Kindle was in use. NOT ACCEPTABLE for this cost!!!",Only lasts for less than 1 year!

1,"Too expensive. Should be included, at no extra cost, with the Kindle.","Too expensive. Should be included, at no extra ..."
1,My old kindle charger works fine - that wasn't clear when I bought a new kindle white. And now you want to charge me 6.95 to send it back. Forget it!! I'll keep the extra charger,A charge to return!!
1,This is honestly a little expensive. And I can find other ways to charge my devices.,Unnecessary
1,A waste of money. You don't need this. Just plug your tablet into your computer and the charge lasts for a month.,A waste of money
1,Do not pay attention to their ad. It says the plug is not included with the kindle and it absolutely is. If they lie about this sort of thing what else do you think the lie about. Steer clear these guys are rip off artist.,Stay away. It is included.
1,"Just got home and found the packet is empty, there is no product we ordered in it. What do we do now","Just got home and found the packet is empty, ..."
1,feel it should have come with paperwhite kindle and that I should not have had to buy it,One Star
1,Whats the point of this without the cable to charge!,Stupid purchase
1,The charger won't stay securely connected to the Paperwhite and wiggles. It will only charge when held at a particular angle.,Unreliable hardware
1,Am used to Kindle Fire which I love. No light to read by in the dark. Hard to navigate. This was a gift - would never purchase on my own.,HATE IT!!!!!
1,This device is OK for reading or listening to audiobooks via Overdrive app. Wouldn't recommend it though really. Waited to buy Kindle for years. Would suggest doing research before buying this device.,Extremely slow
1,Not Kid friendly at all. Purchased for little nephew. Wasn't given any info on it for sales person either. Took back!!!,Terrible
1,Screen was cracked but the package did arrive earlier than expected,Arrived broken
1,Purchased two of these tablets. Both of them had 4-7 dead pixels all over the screen. Read a lot of online reviews which stated same problem. The screen/resolution is pretty bad but what can you expect for $50.,Ok tablet I must have got 2 bad ones
1,I don't like this tablet as Android is not working well,this is my worst purchase
1,I can't get my tablet to set the time so I haven't been able to even use it a little disappointed with this purchase no instructions came with it!!,Wish it had instructions
1,"It wouldn't connect to internet. Tried at home, at a couple of Wi-Fi spots and at the store where I bought it.",Nice but No
1,Bad performance. Slow device. Not worth buying. Better products are available in this range.,Rishav
1,I bought this for my daughter during the holidays and after four months of use it would no longer would charge. I tried other charges as well and it's definitely the tablet. Now I have to go through the hassle of seeing if I can still replace it under warranty.,Didn't last
1,"I bought this for my 8 yr old niece, she loves it. Also bought a screen shield & a 'kid proof' case. However, neither stopped the screen from cracking the first time she dropped it. At least it was only $50 :/My nephew has an 1st gen iPad Air, w a kid case; he's dropped it many times, the screen is fine. You get what you pay for.",Screen cracked on 1st drop
1,This tablet has little cpu power and is really only made to work with the Amazon Prime crowd. Not what I was looking for.,Only buy if a Amazon person.
1,"The item was on sale over the Christmas period at a great price. Took it home and when I charged it up, the back of the tablet became very hot to the touch and the battery life reduced dramatically. Left it alone, tried it again, this time no issues. Four days later, it did the same thing when I was charging it up again. Sent it back for a refund.","Great price, bad first experience"
1,I regretted buying this item.I will never recommend this to anyone,Really bad
1,"Got this during Christmas rush and didn't think much of it since it was slightly open. (They had none in stock and needed 4 of them for all my children ) upon opening item , one had a small crack (bearly noticeable ). Increased useage of item cause the screen to spider web... tried to return but no help with management .... store at fountains in El Paso Texas . So I have 3 perfect kindles and one cracked .... very disappointed 1 star",Open item
1,"I got this tablet for Christmas and only used it for one day. The next day I could not use it, it keep glitching. When I got it, the box was opened and it had an inspect sticker on the box, I guess that is what Best Buy does. I think someone switched it out. I took it back to Best Buy to see if someone could fix it and they said it would be $200 to fix or call Amazon. Why would I pay $200 to fix a tablet that was $40. Amazon is replacing my defected one for free after many attempts to fix it.",Horrible
1,"can not down load any apps from goggle play, didn't know amazon and goggle don't have agreements to sharge",Disappointed
1,"purchased it tonight, time is wrong, you cannot change time manually because it has to have wifi to update the time.....AND IT WON'T CONNECT TO ANY WIFI THAT NEEDS A PASSCODE OR PASSWORD BECAUSE IT HAS TO HAVE CORRECT TIME!!!!!!! THIS IS 2016 TECHNOLOGY AMAZON? I've had many devices, but none that make you find a WIFI without a password (hard to do because starbucks, hotels, etc. all need you to click to agree to their terms for wifi...) all because the time cannot be changed without wifi!!!Returning it tomorrow!!!!!P.S. ALSO AN ISSUE ON THE AMAZON FORUMS, SO I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE DEALING WITH THIS!","beware the ""incorrect time"" problem ...going back"
1,"I purchased this for my son thinking it would be a good beginner tablet. I was so wrong. I couldn't even get it set up for him to use it. Before you comment that it may be the user, I have set up every electronic device I have purchased for myself or my children (compters, cell phones, lap tops, game systems) This tablet would not connect to wifi. I even took it across town thinking it could try that but still nothing. Maybe it was defaulty equipment. I sat right beside him and had perfect wifi. My other son sat right beside him had perfect Wifi.",Poorqualty
1,This device would be the best possible tablet for the money if it had Google Play. However Amazon chose to block access to it. This took their well made tablet with a beautiful screen and great performance from an amazing value to a waste of money. This is my last amazon branded product.If you use a lot of apps or want specific apps shop for another device.,5 star device crippled by amazon
1,I got 6 of them they didn't have google plus me no like,it did work
1,Great tablet for kids but the screen isn't as strong. Charging port is very poorly built,Fire
1,Charge the device and was able to set up everything and when I came back to use it it would not work,Does not work
1,I love using it to read and surf the internet. It is also very handy.,A great tool to use to read and surf the internet.
1,"I totally love the Kindle Fire tablets purchased for my grandkids. My sister purchased one in our hometown for my mother. She is equally happy. My granddaughter and grandson spend their wind down time in the evening on the tablets playing their favorite games. In addition, they want a dog and conduct research for the type of dog that the would like. Overall, the tablets are easy to use and provides technology for them when they visit every other weekend. I am pleased.",Great for my grandkids and mother.
1,"Unfortunately, the first time I plugged the Tablet in to charge it up, the battery overheated and shorted out the tablet. I returned it to Best Buy for a full refund with no hassles.",Battery malfunction
1,"it didn't work I had to return it after Christmas and buy something else, made for a wonderful Christmas mourning","it didn,t work had to be returned"
1,"Slow, advertisement plagued. Save and spend money on something better.",Not worth it
1,"This tablet disappointed me from the beginning. I loved my previous Fire tablet. However, this new one disappointed me from get go. I do not want it to tell me what I like or want! I do not like ads that pop up, I do not want suggestions for me on books, movies or anything else. I know what I like! I definitely do not want it talking to me! In this day and age, with identity theft prevalent, I would like to be able to have apps without having to turn on features like location, etc.. All in all, I am ready to bust it up and throw it away!",Very Disappointed!
1,"The first time I buy my first tablet it came on but it only showed that it needed to reeboot, it then shut off by its self.",Didn't work first time powered on
1,Will never buy a amazon tablet for games again it dosent have Google play and the games take forever to download!!!,Not a good tablet for games

1,i have bought at least 6 people this kindle it is perfect......,love amazon kindle
1,"After only 4 days, the device would not charge. It was plugged in each evening and on the 4th day, it was at 7% after being plugged in all night. This was our second Amazon Fire Tablet, the first one stopped charging in month 13, right after the manufacturer's warranty expired. Decided to get another one because it was a great deal, but sadly I've learned you don't even get what you pay for with this tablet.",Tablet won't charge
1,Didn't like it. To many pop up ALL THE TIME. Don't recommend at all,Crazy pop ups
1,"Bought this for my nephew. The price is right, however, the tablet is terrible. Spend the money and get an iPad.","Price is right, product isn't"
1,I do not like the layout. I want to remove stuff from the screen and can't . I don't like some of the lock out features like playing songs for the kids. i do not like all the advertisements. I don't like the screen doesn't go dark when i want it to such as when music is playing. I liked the samsung,i do not like the fire
1,"From the minute you turn it on there's advertising. The OS is very different from a standard tablet OS - I couldn't get an app that I wanted from the Google Play Store - it just wouldn't work on this. As I said before, I found the amount of advertising just ridiculous.",Tons of advertising
1,Honestly the worst tablet ever owned. Was very slow and unreliable would switch off,Kindle tablet
1,"I read reviews before making a decision for my purchase, but ended up returning the device as I was expecting an experience like that of an Android tablet.",Did not meet expectations
1,I don't have wi fi. so I can't use the device. I'm returning it. I wanted something that my father could use as an e reader. I thought I would be able to download books via my computer using the usb cable. You can't do this unless you are registered. You cannot register unless you have wi fi. Amazon needs to fix this. This is a major flaw.,Must have wi fi
1,Didn't know you had to buy space and many other things for this item to work.,REQUIRES BUYING many things including space
1,"It's very appealing for the price, but know in advance that the warranty is only 90 days... I did not. So when my sons device stopped charging due to a lose charging port a little over 2 months after he got it, I didn't rush to call. I have been taking care of seriously ill family members so I put customer service on the bottom of my list of priorities since I thought I had time,,, especially knowing that these types of calls can sometimes take hours which I didn't have. Today my son was home sick, so I had the day to do the things at the bottom of my list so I called Amazon. 52 minutes later, after doing all their trouble shooting steps THREE times and being disconnected once, she decided to tell me that my warranty was only for 90 days but she would be happy to help me buy one for only $49.99........ Ok. After I calmly explained to he that that was full price and I wasn't about to spend that again on a device that barely made it two months, she put me on hold and 5 minutes later she told me that they would generously give me $10 off my next purchase.Moral of the story, know before you buy & if you still buy, call the minute the thing breaks, even if that means your mom will be an hour late for chemo I guess.Also, during my 45 minute search for who to call about the defect (since it wasn't on the box) I found the Amazon support number on a thread with at least 200 other people talking about their defective charging ports. Keep that in mind.If $50 is something you can spend every 2 months, it might be worth it????",Understand Warranty before throwing out $50
1,"So slow, camera not good, very low quality of picture.. Get Apple iPad mini instead.",Low Quality Tablet
1,"I've bought over 10 replacement charging wires, the ones with the micro mail end that inserts into the Fire to charge it. After one or two uses, the wires become loose and fall out. They definitely won't stay put to charge. Does anyone else have this problem? What's the solution? If not for this, I would recommend it.",charging wires won't stay put
1,"Worked fine for a month, then refused to take a charge. Returned to best buy, and advised that amazon like to handle their own warranty issues. Stuck with a store credit card. I suppose it will get used, but not impressed with the product at all",Disappointed
1,"Table overall was ok but after 30 days it wouldn't work, and there was no warranty after 30 for Best Buy so I just waste 30 for nothing",It's went out after 30 days

1,"Ouch. I bought this Fire tablet, and used it for about four hours, and left it on a charger. A couple of hours later, I picked up the tablet, and the screen was showing a weird 'ghosting' effect, and then the screen went completely black.I twisted the chassis and screen a bit and managed to get things working again, just long enough to do a factory reset and return the tablet.I'm sure I had a defective/damaged tablet, but I was underwhelmed with the quality, and it would be nice if Amazon brought back the higher quality HDX tablets, for people who don't mind paying more for quality tablets.",Amazon should bring back the HDX tablets

1,"I bought this and the kids version past Christmas. Its lack power and storage to be useful unless you want to just read books. Don't waste money on this product. The kids version is a good ideal but loading the apps, when they work takes forever. When they do work, the kids enjoy them. So I consider it to be a hit and miss.

1,"Had to replace my sons lenovo android tablet and at the same time renew the warranty. Had a few options of brands to choose for the replacement. Lots of family suggested the Amazon even the best buy staff said it was the better choice not to mention the cheapest of the four brands to pick from. Well set up was a disaster. I wasn't aware that this tablet let's you put up to four names under one Amazon account, until after the initial account member name was completed. So now my 7 yr old has an Amazon account. Also didnt lime that i had to put in credit info for set up. And then had to go into settings to put a parental block on in-app purchases. Too many ad pop ups and thats just while it is turning on. In not happy with this tablet . It automatically backs up photos and stuff to an iCloud. I don't know what that is , how to access it, nor is there an icon on the screen for it.

1,My son had the original kindle fire. It was great! Simple to use. It finally bit the dust. I bought a new one. They made it way to complicated. It is going back. The power button won't turn off.

1,When I first got it was great until it stopped charging and wouldn't turn back on,Not great at all
1,I bought 2 of these on Black Friday and these have to be one of the worst buys of my life!!!! The screen saver can't be changed so my kids are forced to look at ads every time they want to use their tablet. Apps are ok and to be honest I could have dealt with the ads but the final deal breaker for me is the sd card. I bought my kids sd cards so they can have more than 4 games and the tablet doesn't read it or something. It says sd card inserted but it won't download apps to the sd card!,Weird ads as a screen saver
1,I honestly didn't care for it. The newest versions of this tablet are by far much better. You have a bit more freedom with it than you do the older version.,Just don't

If you buy this, don't count on getting online very seamlessly.

For those that know what a real kindle should be like, you may want to pass on this one. Another version should be along soon and since they can't get much worse than this one you'll probably get a better one.

We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we're out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there's some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. It just slides in and out. We've had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning.

This kindle doesn't show all my books that are in my cloud..it doesn't matter that they aren't in my device but they should still show up in my cloud...I have to go to my amazon account and transfer the book I want to my device.",Great for someone who doesn't have alot of books
1,Paper white does not allow you do use books from the library as you cannot load apps. Only books from Amazon are available to read.,Unable to access library
1,Our daughter loves the size and portability of the product. Her iPad died and she uses her Mac book for school so this was a great choice for her to read books on.,Gift for our college daughter
1,"I purchased this ereader because it stated you could get library booksvia USB cord (and Wifi if you are near one). I do not have Wifi andthe USB would not transfer. Tried everything, neighbor tried, readinstructions, viewed YouTube. But it wouldn't work. Took it back but it was beyond 15 days and they would only give me credit. I then upgraded to Wifi 3g and that better work for the extra money. Very disappointed as I felt I had no other choice.",Transfer library books via USB
1,I took it back the day after purchasing it. The screen looks like you are scrolling through old news print. Blacks out each moment you move it. I thought it was a defect but nope. According to the geek squad that's just the way it is now :(,Terrible operation
1,"We started out great. We had a great thing going. I loved her, she was easy on the eyes, and looked great in any light. Then 7 months into it, I could no longer turn her on. I tried the reboot with no luck. She is still under warranty but that doesn't matter because Best Buy's return policy stinks. If I do try to replace her, I will not buy it here.",Started out great
1,"Not for the average computer person. Very confusing instructions. I spent several hours trying to install the ""overdrive"" so I could get e-books from the library. Ran the battery down several times with no luck. I got so disgusted I had to just put it down. (I'm still trying because I refuse to give up) Thinking about just returning it and the nice leather case too!)",I found it very difficult to set up.
1,"I HATE this machine. First, I specifically asked the salesperson if I could connect to the internet. He assured me I could. It does not. Second complaint is that you can't just press the book and delete it. You have to go to Amazon to do this. I hated it so much I gave it away.",Horrible product
1,"Used it for 2 days and the screen froze 5 times--the kindle just won't switch on. Had to restart each time, and sometimes restarting won't help. It is clearly defective. Brought it to a Bestbuy store to exchange, but custumer service won't replace it. Asked me to look on the kindle shelf and there was none. Then they said they could give me store credit, and I would go line up in checkout and order a new one. Since I got mine on a discount, I had to pay the price difference!! This is ridiculous. They wouldn't order a replacement for a defective product, unless I pay more?? Got a refund in the end even though I liked the product otherwise and would much prefer an exchange. I guess purchases with discounts are not protected.",Defective and store won't exchange
1,"Asked a Bestbuy employee if I could connect to my library. He told me yes so I bought the Kindle. When I got it home, found out that downloading books from my library was not an option, so I returned Kindle.",Disappointed
1,"Easy to use, load books and to read in out door light conditions. Very light to hold and read.",Excellent e reader in all light conditions.
1,I eventually had to return it because of the shades of yellow in the back-light when using it at night. It was okay at day time but at night during which I usually read it was not what i expected to be premium cost product. Especially it was very annoying to read in the landscape mode. I guess Amazon needs a better QA department.,Defective Product
1,"Very disappointed that my Kindle Voyage, purchased in April, failed after just two uses. Went to charge it tonight to take on a business trip and it won't charge, won't reset, etc. Since my Best Buy receipt says I only have 15 days to return it, tried calling Amazon support. Their only solution after over 30 minutes on the phone is to process a replacement which may be a new or may be a refurbished device-- unacceptable to replace a less than 2-month old device with a refurbished one... but, given the poor experience I've had with the Voyage, I'm not even comfortable with a 'new' replacement at this point. Amazon says they can't do anything about a refund because I purchased from Best Buy-- 15 days seems a little extreme in a situation like this with a defective product!Stuck with a $200 paperweight :-(",Device failed after two uses
1,"My Kindle Voyage is nearly 16 months old and worked perfectly. I kept receiving emails from Amazon about the software update. I switched off airplane mode, switched on wifi and shortly after the screen locked up. I have tried everything with customer support and they now tell me I will have to buy a new one. I am very annoyed. If I had left the software as it was my Kindle Voyage would still be working.",Amazon Voyage dead trying to update software

1,Slow response. Wait 5 sec to turn a page. Frustrating. Best Buy says too bad so sad for me.,Waste of money
1,"I have never had so many issues with a kindle and I have purchased alot. It's slow. It shuts off whenever it wants, the sd card dosent read half the time. And when it does it seems to be downloading it. And it deleted apps off my other kids kindle or adds when I do ... very very stupid . It has cracked . And I have never dropped it . It isn't made well. I am going to return it and I will probably never buy another kindle . HORRIBLE",Disappointed
1,"Found this tablet to be very intrusive with adds, almost forced to use credit card to make things work.",No freedom here
1,"Stay away from the certified refurbished Amazon Fire TV. I received two Certified Refurbished defective fire TVs. The first the screen looked half corrupted, see the pictures. The second Certified Refurbished Amazon fire tv I received would not boot up, it was stuck in an infinite loop where I would only see the amazon logo for 10 seconds then it would boot up again.If anything, Amazon needs to re-visit its refurbishment process and quality control of the refurbished products they let get in consumer hands.Update 11/28/16: I purchased a new Fire TV during the BF sale and I have had no issues so far :).","Purchase a new one, stay away from the refurbished fire tv."
1,"I bought this thinking since we'd bought several other refurbished things that worked, that it would be okay. The box never booted properly so the only thing we could stare at was the Amazon logo and the words Unknown Boot in the corner. Customer Service tried to help with the box but we couldn't get it to trouble shoot. Sending this box back.",Never booted
1,"Certified garbage! Lesson learned about paying attention to reviews. Fire TV box and remote was packaged like new, even included new batteries. After plugging it in it would only show Amazon logo and 'unknown boot' on screen. Cycled power several times and even tried to reset using remote buttons, no dice. I read all the negative reviews before I purchased this, I chose to take the chance so I'm angry with myself, but very disappointed with Amazon for even suggesting this is refurbished, let alone certified, as if that means something.",Certified Garbage!
1,"Hopefully, this will at least work as an e-reader. Otherwise, Amazon has it locked up so tight one cannot do much else with it. And, even with my fiber optic Wi-Fi it is slower than cold molasses in January in Canada. Well, I needed a Kindle e-reader and for $40 that is ok.",Good Price But That is Alll
1,This item is no good... will only last for 3 months & amazon basically tells you to f*** off,Will only last for 3months
1,Bought two of them first one would not charge after the first day. The second one The screen went blank so I have to return it now only after a couple of days of use. Will not purchase any more of this kind.,Don't buy
1,"charging port fault appeared in tablet after 2 weeks of purchase from BB, I went to BB store for warranty claim, they said to contact Amazon for any issue, Amazon said they didn't recognise my order in their system. Ended without any remedy.",NO WARRANTY COVERAGE
1,We got this for our son. He is always wanting to play on Mom's tablet so we thought this would be a good choice. His aunt does a lot of tech shopping and bought this same one for his sister so we got the same one. Within a month the charging cord on both units quit working and shortly after that the ports became squirly so you have to hold them just right or they don't charge. Save your money and get a more expensive but better quality product.,Not what we should have bought
1,"I have bought 2 tablets for my son and didn't open it after I received it because it was a birthday gift for them and when they open it on their Big day 1 of the tablet didn't turn on ,the screen is just purple I m out of country right now and will be back on August 4,2107 and I emailed BEST BUY ""Geek Squad "" and told them the whole situation but nobody responded,very disappointed it was a surprise gift for my kiddos and 1 of my son was really upset that tablet won't turn on,let's see if Best Buy read my review and take some action !!!","Tablet doesn't ""TURN ON""!!!"

1,You need gooooood wifi for this. If the wifi isn't good like it's in and out this will not work that good. You also need the app to set up alexa. I would only recommend this if you have great wifi,Amazon echo black
1,"Device does not stay connected to wifi, always disconnecting. This makes product unusable for alarms and timers. When used to work with harmony, at times, does not turn on all devices. Over priced and overrated. Purchased Google Home, for the past week, it has not lost contact with wifi, and works perfectly with harmony hub. Difficult setup with echo, even with 5-6 times with echo support, they can't figure it out. Wish I could return, not too late.",Does not work properly
1,We love it (that's me & my wife) . My son & daughter-in law & 2 grand-girls all love it.,Excellent
1,"Found out after having had opened and tried programming this awesome alexa that basically nothing comes with it. It's a listening device in my home that won't do anything unless I pay more into Amazon. The fact that I synced my pandora account is pointless because I have to spell out what I want Alexa to play by saying, ""Alexa play 'X' station from my pandora play list."" How is the rest of my family suppose to know what to request when I am the only one who knows my pandora play list (and barely at that!) I have many complaints, and basically disappointed in my purchase. I was lead to believe this was the radio of the future. It is if I pay for the Amazon Music Unlimited monthly.",purchased without research unimpressed
1,This device plays on the fact that you must subscribe to their stuff or this is just a empty cylinder that tells you the weather and that's it. And even then there is a subscription required for everything. Google Home at least plays general music lists and a number of other key actions.,Subscribe or Nothing Works
1,"Unless you have fiber optic internet, don't buy this. If you have ATT Uverse it will mess up the TV, lower the speed of your internet, and play havoc with the phone.It has not worked yet since getting it, since I only have 25mgb of internet, and it really does not work at that speed at all.",Works well only with fiber optic internet
1,Never knows answers to question or has the song I want. And always says not getting connection. It sucks,Terrible
1,Great Servive Best Buy and the price match is great I used it both at best buy,Good functioal product
1,The sound quality of the speaker in my opinion is not worth the extra cost versus a Echo Dot. I could spend the difference on a separate speaker to use with the Dot and also have the flexibility of using that speaker elsewhere.,Disappointing
1,This product not good waste of money I would recommend it,Not good
1,Alexa answers maybe 1 out of 10 questions we ask her - she uses Bing.com and it is really bad. Her standard answer is - I don't know the answer to this question. We ask her easy questions about stats or people. We also have a Google home and it answers almost every question right.,does not perform like advertised
1,"Not as easy as it sounded like it was going to be. So many things to buy to get full use out of what we knew we COULD do. Every question we seem to ask Alexa/she says she doesn't know the answer and that we'd have to ""download the app"" - so we never use her/only to ask her to set a timer and tell us the time and ask her to play music, which we also had to set up first. Not as neat as we thought she was going to be.",Not what we expected
1,Product was damaged. Needs lot of improvement on the API's.,Its not recognizing lot of sentences.Lot toimprove
1,"I was tokd if you had wfi there would be no problem to make it work. Wrong, I already gave it to the person and they cannot make it work, they do not have a smart phone, but have computer and wifi... Im afraid I will have to return the item.",I was told it was an easy installation ..NOT
1,I was excited about the Amazon echo. However after getting it home setting it up and finding out how limiting it is that excitement went away fast. The echo couldn't answer the majority of questions or would be asked a question and instead of answering it would play country music which I never asked for.Unless you have smart home features like a smart thermostat or smart lights etc it is useless aside from being a speaker which for the money it isn't a good speaker.I did however try it for a week finding it not worth it or that googling questions was easier to answer. Even asking it about what movies were near me etc was a pain. Some said maybe I got a defective unit which wasn't the case the echo is just limited in what it can do.I would say save your money this isn't worth it yet.,Not worth the money or time
1,I tried to set it up for over an hour and it wouldn't connect to my wifi. The orange ring didn't last more than 30 sec to even give it a chance. It just sat their with the ring of death no matter how quick I was. Powered my router off and back on even. My other devices were connected just fine before and after. So frustrated and no matter how hard I tried it didn't work so I just took it back and got a refund. Totally disappointed!,Totally disappointed
1,"Will not stay connected to WiFi. When it is connected, device has to be within 6-8 ft. of router. Need this in the kitchen. Don't want to walk 25+ feet to use it.

1,I love how easy it is to use and setup the Echo you just plug it in and you are ready to go.,Echo
1,Alexa is not able to answer more than basic querys,Don't see much benefit from the product
1,"If I could give it a lower rating, I would.This is nothing more than a speaker, and a big one.It is NOT wireless so you cannot even take it outside w/o a power source. You cannot ask questions and have Alexa search answers. Very expensive. Would like to try google but since I cannot return this - I can't justify the price. Everyone said give it time to like Alexa. I gave it too much time and did not realize you had to return within a time frame (my bad).",Don't waste your money!
1,Returned it.. didn't work like we thought it was so supposed to. Pain on the butt.,Not for me

1,"I have Alexa now 5 months running.You would expect, that Alexa can anwser many, many questions. It can (maybe), but you have to know which App has the answer, you have to install the app and you have every time to say a special commands . Stupid. Alexa is out of the box very stupid. And after investing hours - she is not much more knowledgeable. It's a stupid AI.",Not as good as expected and promised.
1,This item is useless to play music through voice recognition unless you pay for an amazon prime or Amazon music account. Once that is disconnected she only plays your music through manual control from a blue tooth connection from your phone. Pointless!!! More than half the questions I ask her she doesn't know the answers to. The only thing she's good for so far is the time and weather. That basically the most expensive blue tooth speaker and clock I have ever purchased. I want my money back,Alexa Malexa
1,"This thing has major connectivity issues, save your money and wait for a later version.",Dont buy
1,"I purchased this item on the recommendation of many existing owners. However, when I got home and attempted to set up the device, it was frustrating and the instructions/FAQs were not very helpful. The echo could not find my NEST thermostat, nor could it find about half of my HUE lights. Once I argued and fought with Alexa for about 45 minutes, she finally started to pick up my lights and after COMLETELY re-configuring my thermostat, she could see it, but she would not work with it. Once she found all of my lights, she would turn them on or off, but would not change colors or brightness levels. I run a software company and have worked in and with computers my whole life. This should not have been this quirky. I would not recommend this item. Get a Google Home.",Not intuitive - Overly argumentative.
1,"Bestbuy came through before the holiday better than Amazon--item available, arrived within 2 days, competitively priced. Great service there. My problem is with disappointing performance by Echo. Siri wins over Alexa. Issues encountered:1) a skill will be installed, but Alexa will tell me first, I need to install the skill and second, that the skill is already installed. User is stuck in a do-loop with no response.2) access to quick 1-sentence read from Wikipedia is appreciated, but if you ask 'tell me more,' Alexa's voice is so rushed and computerized, some of the information is unintelligible.3) tons of skills, but so many of them are at a micro level and others are 1-time gimmicks. If you are not careful, you then need a skill to help you with all the skills you've installed.4) responses on some of the more interesting skills are just plain wrong. Vocabulary on word master is limited, so you will told your response is not a word that begins with ""X"" and we have had instances where our correct response on Jeopardy is reported as not correct. In one skill about a magic door (?) a clue is described, but when selected, you are sent backward a step with the same clue offered again. Frustrating and makes you feel you are doing something wrong or not speaking clearly. Children can get frustrated quickly.5) access to music is quirky. Some pieces by classical composers will play only a few minutes of a selection, abruptly stop and begin a new piece. But some singers and ambient pieces will play for hours.Positives: flash briefing, weather, word definitions, Pandora access timer.",Disappointing
1,I really wanted this as a Christmas present however it's nothing like the ads. Alexa works sometimes and then not. I can't get her to play music or listen to the radio through her. Very disappointed. Plan on taking it back.,Disappointed
1,It wouldn't connect with any of my smart home items it wouldn't understand some commands,Wasn't impressed
1,"For me, it is only great for playing english-language music. I may try to connect to light switches and socketsss through something like nest, but until then, answering questions about history and societyit fails.",doesn't respond with answers to most questions
1,"Echo simply did not do anything it was advertised to do. Basic weather was sporadic and more detailed questions resulted in ""Cannot find response"".",Unit could not even answer basic questions.
1,"Bought this as a present for my boyfriend, and we both were very disappointed. I read lots of reviews and thought it would be an awesome gift to give. Alexa is a Siri downgrade. Don't waste your money on this.",Terrible
1,"Let's be realistic on two fronts about the Echo: (1) I'ts fun to play with, a novel idea. (2) There are some serious flaws and if you doubt me you can try these yourself. Ask Alexa these three questions:(1) ""What is the Customer Service Number for UPS?"". You'll be told the phone number of your nearest UPS store. No matter how you phrase the question.(2) ""Alexa, what is the current humidity outside?"". You'll get the days weather report no matter how you pose the question. Seriously, it cannot even provide the Humidity?(3) ""Alexa, Who makes the 747 Jet?"". You'll hear ""Hmmm, I'm not sure what you meant by that question. So throw in a clue with ""Alexa, who makes the Boeing 747 Jet?"" and you'll hear the same answer. And this product is alleged to go out to the web to pull down information from Wikipedia, et al?(4) The reproduction of music is egregious at best. Read anywhere on the Internet and you'll see this mentioned time and time again. It's very, very bad. Imagine a 1960's Transistor Radio not quite tuned well..(5) The voice quality sounds like something from a Commodore-64 back in the 1980's. Another very common complaint you'll read about in reviews.This is going back tonight. Not worth the $179.00 and I feel it's slated to go the route of the Pet Rock (for those who remember it).",Seriously Needs Improvement - Overrated!

1,1 star...because it worked 1 time and stopped working.Returned it the very next day!My husband's Nexus charger and the Belkin 10W charger (that he got to replace this charger) do a GREAT job charging my Kindle Fire 8.9 HDX!,Don't do it!
1,I bought this charger Nov 28 2015. It's now Jan 1 2016 (a little over a month later) and the device doesn't charge my kindle any longer. I have the kindle shutdown and allow it to be plugged in for multiple hours. After I take the charger off and start to use my Kindle within 30 minutes I see the Low Battery message. If I use the charger that came with my Kindle for the same amount of time I don't see the Low Battery message as quickly as I did with this charger. Not sure what's going on but makes me think I have a faulty device -- costs a lot of money for something that doesn't work any longer than 1 month,Device does not seem to be charging my Kindle - maybe its broken
1,This doesn't power anything. I got this for my dad for Christmas and we just thought his Kindle was bad..nope..tried it on other things and it won't charge anything...I want my money back or a replace meant...maybe this unit is just bad! But 20 bucks down the drain!,Power fast How about power not!
1,Truly I should have tried to get a refund. I threw out the packaging before I realized how poorly it works. This charger only works every third day when held at a particular angle. The planets almost need to align for it to charge my Kindle. Complete disappointment.,Complete Disappointment

I had already bought my own cover, for a lot cheaper, that has more shock protection and that one won't stand on end, but at sits securely at a tilt which makes it more useful for me. The cheaper one I bought on Amazon also has a magnetic closer to the cover stays closed. This one does not. Not sure how to tell the person who bought me this that I don't like this one at all.

You can safely use up to 5.25 watts and anything between .5 and 1 amp (500mA-1000mA).If you don't have an extra cell phone charger lying around just buy a well reviewed power adapter with the above specifications that connects to your Kindle (micro USB).

We have had this product for just over one month and I have had to contact Amazon Support, perform factory resets to get content to show up, and the device is poorly designed as the SD card pops out constantly, which messes with DRM, and does you no good if this happens when you are not connected to the Internet to fix it. We are returning, and spending the extra money for an iPad. Will not purchase another kindle device unfortunately just based on this experience. If you just use the device for reading, maybe this is for you, but trying to download information to SD card and actually being able to access it has been beyond frustrating, as well as having to do factory resets so content owned/ already purchased on Amazon would show up on the device in the library.",Have never purchased a more frustrating Device

The Echo CANNOT control the Amazon Fire TV which was the sole reason I bought it. Well.. also in hopes that HBO Now would have Surround Sound on it, but of course it didn't. So they're both at fault here and the reason why I returned it immediately. Since neither of the above worked, this made the device completely redundant with my Chromecast.",Disappointed - No Echo control
1,This item is the worst ever a d the tech support is even worst. Spent hour troubleshooting and their solution was to return it to Bestbuy a d get anotherone. So i did. And guess what? It didn't work ether. Basically the Netflix app can't be downloaded becuse the Amazon Fire tv won't let you and to make it worst if you're a fan of HBO brace yourself becuase the app isn't even available on their app store. HBO simply doesn't exist. I spent in total 4 days troubleshooting with the Amazon team actually managing the Fire TV remotely from their offices and the answer was that ether the equipment is defective or that they don't have Netflix or HBO available for it. REALLY ITS FREAKING ADVERTISED ON THE BOX. DONT WAIST YOUR MONEY. better get an apple tv or a roku,Don't even bother
1,First day of purchase it overheats. Defective product.,Over heats
1,Buyer beware They say it's free tv...ITS NOT!You have to pay for everything! I wish I would have bought this before I cancelled my cable.,Don't buy!
1,"Hated it ! You have to purchase everything from Amazon ! Took it back within a couple days! Got the roku ,,,,, way better !",Fire sucks
1,Never bought this item at all. So i guess you must have the wrong person,Didn't buy
1,It's hard to give a review cause it's stuck on Amazon home screen. It might be a good product but I don't know,Stuck on Amazon screen
1,I can't seem to be able to hook it up with my internet connection. I will be returning it to the store.,I don't like it.
1,I tried this out for a few weeks and it does not have nearly the programs that it says it does. I would rather pay for Netflix or Hulu.,Poor
1,Tried setting this up on 2 TV's using both WIFI and Ethernet for hours. Could never get a signal. A total waste of time.,Setup is a joke
1,"If you don't care about live tv this will do great for you. Otherwise, can't ditch the cord yet.",Not what I expected
1,It locked up on installing kodi and it wouldn't recover. The device buffers during first setup of any movie. Voice remote is not the best.,Not for Experienced User
1,"At first, the fire box was great. After two months the remote stopped working. I'd say save some money and just get the fire sticks. I have two of them and no problem. The fire tv box has been nothing but issues.",Remote stopped working
1,"i bought two fire tv boxes and both of them have problems, the problem is that the remote suddenly stops working and then it comes back and works, sometimes it takes a few minutes for it to start working. That never happen with the roku",not so good
1,"I can't return through Best Buy, because it's over 15 days. Started out ok, but then it just stopped working. It keeps freezing at home screen and I can't access anything. Extremely disappointed.",Stopped working after 2 wks
1,HAD THE AMAZON FIRE TV BOX FOX 1 WEEK AND IT BROKE,NEER AGAIN
1,On the second day the unit disconnected from my wireless network and when attempted to reconnect the remote would not work and I could not click on the network settings button. I return that unit for another Amazon fire and the second unit could not find the remote to pair it. I think I will purchase a google or apple next .,I had to return my unit stop working after 1 day
1,I had no cable but had internet so I thought this Amazon item would be good. Basically you have to pay for each subscription to use this making it super costly. I retuned this and just use Netflix with a wifi enabled tv.,Not worth it
1,Poor choice The product did not work after only one week it froze on me and I was unable to get it to go to the factory reset I would not recommend this product at this time I will call Amazon back to ask for my money and a refund after going on line I see that this is a common problem a problem that they should solve,Frozen
1,"Amazon is at the forefront of 4K content, offering several shows in HDR. Then why isn't their very own streaming player capable of displaying it? And at only 30 fps to boot. This was obviously built to a price but if you've already shelled out the money for a 4K TV wouldn't you want it to be able to display all that it's capable of? The Roku is, at present, the far superior product.",Sadly Lacking
1,"Not user friendly. Sluggish, confusing, and extremely frustrating. Returned the item.",The worst thing I have ever purchased
1,Would not recommend to anybody I had to take it back three times and still would not hook up to TVs very poor customer service,Would not recommend to anybody
1,Navigates easily. Many channels. Fast connection speeds.,Excellent Streamer.
1,"I purchased the Amazon Fire TV after owning the Roku 3 for a year and after trying both the older and the newest versions and Apple TV. I am a Prime member so this seemed like a perfect choice. However, the remote is very unresponsive, disconnecting more than it stays connected. The menu layout is very ""ad-centric"" and pushes you towards how Amazon wants you to view their service. When the remote works, the Amazon TV seems sluggish in comparison to the other products I tried. After several hours of fighting with the remote, I decided to return it and get another Roku...possibly the version 4. Good try Amazon, but far from being close to either Roku or Apple TV.",Sadly disappointed
1,After setting up the Amazon Fire it froze on me and I had to return it !,Froze on me
1,Bought two of these 2015 models to add to my previous model on other sets in the house. Both of the new units freeze after about 10 - 15 minutes stating that my 16 MB connection speed isn't fast enough for watching old documentaries from my Prime account. Cycling the power gets it working until it freezes again. The old model works flawlessly. I'll be returning these.,Unreliable
1,"I purchased the Fire tv box and it just stopped working one day. Wont boot, just sits at the logo. I spoke to customer service who could care less. They said the best they could do is sell me another box seeing that my warranty had expired. Its not like I bought this in 2012. Someone there even told me that if I have a ROKU box I can watch it with that instead. TOTALLY UNEXCEPTIONABLE! Me an my wife are long time Prime members and expected a little more from Amazon. I am on my way to buy an Nvidia Shield TV for my streaming needs. BTW it doesnt have an Amazon app (wink). This is the first box I have ever owned that just stopped working.",Bad!
1,"Purchased for viewing Amazon prime. Loaded a couple apps and set it to sleep. When I returned a few hours later it was stuck in a perpetual boot and was not recoverable. I will get another as I like the features and price point, just a little soured by this first impression. I'm checking that I would not recommend to a friend but am hoping this will change with the second one. to be continued...",Worked OK for a few hours...
1,"I bought this Fire TV 3 months ago. One day, out of the blue, it stopped working. Power is on but as soon after I see the Amazon logo the screen goes black. I google the problem and it seems that the only way to reset it to the factory mode is by the on screen menu so there is no way for me to do it. I just emailed the company and waiting for a response since it is unacceptable that this thing only lasted 3 months before it became useless. Not a happy camper here!!!",Stopped Working
1,The supplied Amazon Bluetooth remote control will not pair back with the main unit. This is the second one I bought with the same issue. Re-Pairing the remote is quite simple per the instructions but to no avail. Had to use a android remote with a usb dongle to operate the unit. Going through batteries like crazy trying to get it to pair back up no more than three inches from main unit.,Great Concept Bad Remote Pairing
1,"I have a pretty fast and stable internet connection, 65Mbps down.So when I tried to stream some 4K content, it kept buffering to the point that it just wouldn't load the video anymore. Even streaming 1080p content had some issues. So i used the dedicated apps on my tv to see if I had the same problem, nope. It worked flawlessly! This product just plain sucks.",4K streaming didn't work.
1,"I was so excited to start streaming 4k with this and the disappointment was terrible. It just never seemed to hit 4k while my Smart TV has no problem with it. The only reason I bought it was because I loved the original Fire TV and loved the setup. Also, it was glitchy and laggy. I gave it 2 days and returned it.",BOOOOOO!!!
1,One of the important reasons I purchased this was for HBO Go app which they have but does not work with Charter-Comcast. A quite large market of People affected so a useless claim they readily put out there that you can play it. What else can you not use it for I haven't found yet but Amazon has not written me back after I emailed them about this issue. Im stuck with waste of Money and will go get a Google Chrome now.,Does not Deliver
1,"Basically has almost the same content as a Roku 3 would provide, but in a much more clunkier menu. I can get a better Amazon menu layout via the Amazon app on the Roku 3. Also for those that were hoping to pick up some extra football via FOX sports network (FS1), that is not happening. You can add the channel free, but in order to watch any content you will still need a cable or satellite subscription which defeats the whole purpose of adding the app for us cord cutters. There is NO way I am signing back up for cable or satellite. I wish FS1 would get with the program and offer a separate subscription such as HBO and Showtime do. It's a thumbs down for me.",No FOX sports network (FS1) without a paid cable
1,Bought the fire TV excited about the 4K support. The first night it refused to load video content. I could only stream music. Now it refuses to load at all. It has completely stopped responding to the remote. Remote feels cheap.,Simply doesn't work. Feels cheap
1,I have 4 of the Gen 1 Fire Tv boxes and they are good showing their age. I purchased the new FireTV only be to disappointedPros.. SD Card slotCons.. Many Apps just don't work or are buggy...Search is terrible and only gives Amazon options .. Nvidia Shield also gives my plex server option .. now that is cool... not much faster.. if at all than Gen 1,Almost worth it but falls very short
1,Barely 4k content and it lags a lot. Not worth it. Returned!,Keep looking
1,"I purchased this firetv to upgrade my from first firetv version as I have a samsung 4k tv, this new firetv recognized my hdmi port as 4k compatible when I set the resolution to 4k on video settings, after trying all posible settings, this bug only gives 1080 even playing 4k content. firetv1=firetv2.",not really 4k
1,"Didn't work well in 4K at all. After going in 4K mode and returning back to the menu screen, the Fire Tv would show a black screen and had to be unplugged to start back up. The menu screen isn't in 4K like it is in the Shield Tv which a better item by miles. 4K uses all of the resources of the Fire Tv and other apps have to be closed for it to play 4K videos or it runs into problems such as black screen.",4K Issues
1,"This cover is made for the Kindle DX and fits it beautifully. The problem - and it's a big one - is if you accidentlly try to open the cover from the back (which is very easy to do) you can damage the Kindle without even realizing what's happened. My husband did this and cracked the Kindle frame within the first week of owning the device. Fortunately, only the frame was cracked and the Kindle still works. We cannot, however, remove the cover because of the way it hooks into the device, the hook closure must be bent because of the accidental attempt to open the back cover. After the incident, we attempted to clip the back cover to the Kindle, but found this to be cumbersome and the clip would not stay in place. We are just extremely careful now, but the damage was done almost immediately. I hope this design flaw has been fixed.",Great protection if it doesn't damage the Kindle first!
1,"The reason people give it 5 stars is because they don't give the product enough time before they review it. I purchased this along with my kindle dx on August 12, 2010. I can honestly say that I don't recommend this product as it will damage the kindle. The hinge that attaches to the kindle will eventually put pressure on the kindle front plastic cover and soon you will see it crack. To avoid this, you have to make sure the kindle doesn't rock back and forth from off the back cover causing the hinge to bend more and crack the front plastic further. This is hard to do if you open and close your kindle many times a day or simply lend it to someone else who doesn't know better. One thing I can honestly say is that I really wanted to like this product. I really wanted it to work. I'm looking for a slip cover now.",Eventually Your Kindle Will Crack
1,"I, as well as other Kindle lovers, have noticed that although we have taken great care with the cover, it has warped and has bubbles and is not durable. Within 3 months, and I only started using the Kindle with the cover in the past 2 weeks, noticed the cover has become warped and bubbled under the leather. No idea what would cause this, I have taken great care not to put it near any source that would have done this damage, not sunlight, heat, moisture or anything. I will be requesting a replacement, but Kindle manufacturers of the cover need to do their homework and come up with a better product, especially for the price we paid.","Great at first, warped within 3 months"
1,"So I was already not too pleased with Amazon's choice to only include an essentially useless charger when purchasing a kindle hd, and caved to ordering the fast charger so it would not take hours of non-use to recharge. For 20 you don't even get a full charger, just an adapter to put on to the cord they already gave you. Amazon please just charge the real price for the device instead of settling to slowly rip people off with essential accessories, this sort of thing cheapens your image and erodes loyalty.",Ridiculous
1,"As a charger, it works but is nothing special. With a Mk 1 Kindle Fire, it doesn't seem to charge any faster than the standard charger. And NO CABLE is included!! A Kindle-specific cable must be purchased separately! This is not mentioned in the descriptions.",Not As Expected
1,"This is exactly like any other usb power charger, making it unnecessary. A basic charger used for an ipod works to charge the kindle fire within 3-4 hours.",Not Necessary
1,"Amazon should include this charger with the Kindle. The fact that they're charging us extra for something that should be included is a sign of cheapness. Plus, you can use any micro-USB phone charger instead of this to charge your Kindle. Save your money.",Should be included
1,Love my Kindle Fire but I am really disappointed in the Kindle Power Fast Charging Unit. I've had it two months and I've used it many times - The first two times it worked okay but failerd on the third and many subsequent tries. I've disposed of it and use my wife's iPad Nano charger which always works just fine.,Disappointing Charger
1,I was surprised to find it did not come with any type of charging cords so I had to purchase one and then found my Sprint HTC 3D charger is faster. I would not purchase again- 1st item I've ever not liked I've purchased from Amazon,Not worth the money
1,"to spite the fact that i have nothing but good things to say about amazon and anthing i've ever gotten from them. and that i love my fire. i find it greedy that the wall charger doesn't come with the kindle. not everyone, ok most people, but still not everyone has a usb port to plug into. i'm taking my charger back. i think amazon should make things right and let anyone who purchased a kindle without a charger have one for free, or credit those who had to buy one.",as with everyone else

2,Not a good product short battery life i can only use for 20 minutes,short life
2,"If you shop on Amazon all the time, this will help make it easier still. Lots of ads pop up, and you can't use apps from non-Amazon sources unless you root it, and that is complicated.

2,"We purchased this as a replacement for our now-broken iPad. Though we liked the smaller size (more convenient, easier to carry, etc), the internet was sooooooo slowwwwww that it drove us crazy. Sometimes minutes to download a site (and this with no other apps open!1). Plan to go back to another iPad.",Returned it.. SLOW!!!
2,"Had it for about a week and now it won't take charge, tried new chargers and still not taking charge. Happy with tablet but unhappy about not chatging","Tablet nice, not so nice battery though"
2,This tablet could be so much better if the apps actually worked decently. The built in Amazon pieces for Prime members is great and work flawlessly. But it's not enough to overcome the terrible app behavior and countless freezes.  They need to take a lesson or two from Apple.,Just ok

2,"I got a magenta color because I loved the beautiful purple-ish color shown on the picture. Instead I got a really bright pink-ish color which looks nothing like the color shown here. I went to the store hoping to replace it with a different color but was told that since I bought it on sale, I had to pay the $30 dollar price difference if I wanted to exchange. Unbelievable. The product is good but I never liked the Best buy customer service.",Color difference is HUGE. Bad customer service.
2,"I bought this tablet as a replacement for my wife's Fire TV HDX 8.9 as her battery life is starting to decrease as it is getting older. Unfortunately, she was not happy with it as the tablet is slightly smaller screen wise (the next step is 10"" which is way too big, and has 4 less hours of battery life) and I was disappointed despite it being a newer tablet it was not able to decode HEVC, like the Fire TV 2015 boxes we have connected to our televisions. This unfortunately is a show stopper, as we can't view the movie library we have on this tablet. We will wait until a newer version comes out that is improved.",Disappointed

I returned this item pronto!","This tablet was nice, but..."
2,"I was initially excited to get the Kindle. I am extremely disappointed with all the ads. Even more disappointed to find out that I could pay Amazon more money to remove the ads. It's frustrating that Best Buy and more specifically Amazon, don't let the consumer know on the box or in store advertising that what you're buying is a mini advertising billboard. Why couldn't there be an upfront statement on the box or in the store stating that the ""low price"" is subsidized by all the ads on the device? Would this have changed my purchase? Absolutely!!!! I would have spent a couple bucks more and probably got a Samsung tablet.","Disappointed with device, Mfg, and seller"

We found out the hard way that the Fire (which we bought to replace a misplaced iPad, so maybe we were just spoiled) is pretty limited in terms of the Apps you can download. Forget about any Google based Apps and many of the standard apps that are generally available in the Android or Apple market place. I love Amazon itself and don't have any major issues with the product I got for the price I paid, I just won't be going the cheap route in the future.

I find it blanking in and out and not showing some icons at times. I haven't dropped it so I'm assuming this is an internal problem :( I have tried playing a couple games and it will say that I need ""the Amazon app"" where I go to purchase stuff, which I already have...then it closes out saying ERROR.

2,"...but WiFi isn't working great. I have love Amazon Kindles since my first one, replaced it with a 7"" Fire HD, then got 7"" Fires...multiple ones. Problem is the last 3 work with wifi for a while, then start having problems. Reset wireless modem worked for a while, then hard reset did, now won't work for wifi at all. Will keep trying, though.",Coulda been a Contender...

2,I needed this for my two six year olds to be able to use during our drive to Disney. You are unable to get most apps that are offered on iTunes and android market so I returned.,Not many free apps
2,"Disappointed with this tablet. Get one that uses Android system, not Amazon.",Not what expected
2,The constant bombardment of ads when I turn on my tablet is not an experience that I enjoy. I would recommend you buy ANY other than one that runs the Fire OS. For the same price you can get a cheap android tablet and do a lot more with it.,Not a fan
2,Bought the tablets for my kids. The tablet isn't really friendly for them. The home pages try to take you to amazon stuff only and when they download games it's kind of hard to find them. Battery life can't hold up to a 5yr old. He runs it dead quicker then it can charge.,Not really kids friendly
2,"I wanted a small tablet to read news and watch videos. I have Amazon Prime, so I figured why not, it is really cheap. Well, I believe you get what you pay for. This fire tablet froze on me, when I only had one thing open. I am very disappointed. It also is very slow when you rotate the screen. Ugh! I will be returning it.",Not too happy with this Amazon Fire tablet.
2,Bad graphics. Ugly design. Good for the price. Not recommended.,Not good
2,"Once connected to my wi-fi, it would not connect to daughters wi-fi when I visited her. The loading time for programs is really slow. Oh well, what did I expect for only $49??","So,so"

2,I ran multiple different type of games. Can't handle.,"Good for internet use, not so good for games"
2,Got this because it was on sale and I had a gift card. It is extremely slow using the internet. Hoping to be using it was an e-reader.,Slow
2,Video files transferring issue. Some files appear.,Does the job
2,"The Kindle line is great for easily syncing into existing Amazon accounts & it's a great tablet for basic functions, like internet use, video streaming, music streaming, apps, etc.etc.etc. However, the tablet cannot currently stream downloaded movies from Ultraviolet, which is a pain for most users that primarily bought this device for that purpose. I would currently not recommend the purchase of this device until you find out that Amazon has fixed the issue, if one of your criteria(s) for the perfect tablet is to be able to watch downloaded movies!",Okay Tablet
2,"Just bought my Kindle Fire and although the ""Amazon"" and ""Fire"" come up otherwise the product is dead!!!!!!! I have tried the help section but no help. Taking it back to the store. If it would work I would love it.",Three weeks and doesn't work!

2,"Don't know I bought as gift for my nephew, we will see.",Christmas gift
2,"I bought the tablet for games and surfing the internet. This is a slow tablet, not made for gaming - graphics are commonly not supported. Super cheap tablet, you get what you pay for. Ended up returning it.",Great for someone who wants a basic tablet

2,"Very slow, freezes frequently but it was 34 dollars",Very slow. Freezes frequently

2,"When i opened this tablet there was a white line in the bottom corner of the screen. Everything worked fine but that line was bothering me. I returned it to the store and got a replacement but it had another white line. Other than that it was a good tablet, it is very affordable",Screen can be improved
2,"Worked good for a month, the kids loved it but then just went black and wouldn't come back on. Sending it back to get a new one with the warranty.",Fun while it lasted!
2,Don't like all the ads. Didn't know that they would be permanent because I bought it on sale. It's very slow and has trouble connecting to my wifi.,Eh
2,You get what you pay for. It works but is very slow.,You get what you pay for.
2,I purchased this for my mother in law. She is getting old and wanted something she could see.The font size was never quite right for her and she was often confused by all the attempts this device makes to sell you something. It really wasn't a good fit for her.The device died approximately 1 week after purchase. We returned it for a refund.,Dead within the week.
2,Quality of screen display is lacking and the reason I returned the tablet. For adult users I cannot recommend.,Good tablet for children.
2,"Amazon replaced it as it had gray stripes and no picture on the screen. That one works so overall the Fire was a good purchase. Recommend a memory card, it does not hold much.","It was faulty, had to contact Amazon"
2,Not many apps I'd use. Not as useful as I'd hoped.,Good for kindle
2,"the internet server SILK is not compatible with free wifi on southwest airlines and I bought it to use on the plane. also I cannot hear the audio even with the sound all the way up on the plane. so I don't really need it since I have a computer , iPhone and kindle at home.",i can't use this on the airplane
2,Although a cheap tablet with amazon functionality it's a very slow one.,Get what you pay for
2,Nice tablet for children - Works well as a gift for the price,Amazon Tablet
2,Didn't know that Amazon had control over everything. Should have bought any other tablet.,Don't like
2,"The one purchased at Best Buy had black and gray lines appearing across the screen when powering up. It got worse, to occurring while using it. Amazon was contacted via Chat and determined something was wrong, and exchanged it.

2,T-r-a-s-h.............................................. ....,Good price
2,It is a nice little tablet for on the go or for kids. Wouldn't recommend using it for work,Ok

2,"From the first time I used it, the pages kept freezing and didn't respond to touch commands. I had to turn it off and back on daily. I tried to get a replacement and was told they no longer have them and I'd have to pay $10. more for a newer model. I bought 2 (1 as a gift). So far 1 works and 1 didn't.",quirky and freezes
2,"I bought this tablet on Black Friday and it was on sale. It's incredibly slow, and the screen quality is mediocre. What bothered me the most were the ads on the tablet. I only really use it to watch Netflix- so it's fine, but don't expect anything above that to function well on this device.",You get what you pay for.
2,I would never buy another Amazon product personally. It works well but I'd rather use the rca over this. Personal preference has nothing to do with quality,Poor
2,"In my personal opinion, this product would be unable to satisify any adult, whether it was for business or pleasure. Limited apps, limited space, slow uploading, etc. Also, due to this being an amazon product, many apps and options are unavailable, that are commonly used with both android and apple products. So I would not recommend to anyone.",I would recommend for small children.
2,Gave tablet as a Christmas gift - she uses it all of the time and loves it. She was thrilled to get it I bought the extended warranty so that the tablet would be covererd in case something happened to it. Her mother had seen it advertised and I bought it on thanksgiving day,It was a gift for a grandchild
2,Cheap but biggest problem is I can't get it to download apps. The Internet connection is very weak.,I little disappointment
2,"Nice, clear images, but very slow and the ads on the start screen are annoying. Also, the search engine, Silk, is not very good. Switch to Google if you can. Should have just stuck with the Digiland tablet--a lot more bang for the buck.",not the best
2,"There is not enough battery life to read comfortably. 7 hours, maybe.",not satisfied
2,"I will not recommend this one, do slow and I ended up returning this product",This is slow
2,The Kindle I purchased is a good and expensive tablet useful for reading and internet. It does have a lot of apps already loaded that I do not plan to use and do not know how to delete. I mainly use the Kindle Fire for Facebook and occasionally get on the internet.,Good tablet for reading and internet
2,Not the best and the brightest in the market. Bought two of them and one got damaged within the second month. Best buy was not taking it back and amazon asked a price of a whole new one for repair. Good price though but high possibility that the product might not last too long.,Average product
2,Price is nice but performance was not. Sluggish to the point of frustration even to my 4 year old. Would be fine as ereader or maybe basic web device.,You get what you pay for
2,Don't like that Amazon has so many ads going on this thing. Makes it pretty not fun to use.,Too many ads
2,I felt the system mived extremely slow not good for streaming great reader,Very basic
2,Could not get this to work with my chromecast so I returned it.,Based off of Chrome Cast
2,I purchased 3 kindles for my grandchildren for Christmas last year. I have been very disappointed with their quality. The chargers were very difficult to plug in right from the beginning and now one of the kindles won't even charge at all. The others have to be positioned just right or they won't charge either. I definitely would not recommend this particular model kindle to anyone.,Disappointing
2,"I bought my son a kindle about 6 months ago and it was great.... Until my husband dropped it and broke the screen. So I bought my son another one last week, but I think it might be defective becuz the battery died not fully charge or it takes a super long time to charge, where this did not happen with my last one",Great for kids
2,This product is a great product as long as the plug-in charge port doesn't break and quit taking a charge.,Good Product as long as you can keep it working.
2,"I have had several kindles, this latest one just doesnt seem to be as good of quality as the previous onrs i have owned",Pictute quality and performance low
2,I love dis tablet just wish the screen wasn't crack!,It's ok
2,"Not as good as i though, but at least it does what it is suppoused. Very bad screen quality",Good
2,"I bought this tablet to read Free Epub books that I have, but it didn't allow me to even look for the books, so I have it returned and exchanged for a cheaper one that still does a better job for those who wants to read free Epub books",Not for those who wants to read free ePub books
2,"I use this to read things and purchase items on Amazon. It doesn't play all of my favorite games from the App Store, nor does it sync to my android projector, so I don't really get full use of the larger screen. I think for my uses, I should've just purchased the e-ink version or maybe a full-android version.",Android-lite
2,Purchased the Kindle fire fir my grandfaughter and she loved it. It was so easy for her to use. The size was perfect http://www.hippressurecooking.com/pressure-cooking-times/,Granddaughter loved it
2,This table is okay for me. But it is great for kids,Okay
2,"I got this tablet with high expectations given it's from Amazon. However it was disappointing in many ways and it will be returned.First off, despite of the small screen size, it's heavy. Too heavy to be used as a book reader in bed.The deal breaker for me was that there's no way to connect a VPN using the regular Android settings. The option has been deactivated and accordingly to the tech support, ""it's not available yet, but it will come"". Surprisingly, still according to them, none of the new Amazon tables on sale have such support! Apparently Amazon doesn't believe that open WIFI at coffee shops, supermarkets, airports offer data security risks for the tablet users.On top of that, the Amazon version of ""Google Play Store"" has a reduced number of Apps and the ones I was interested in are not available.And the cherry on the top, was that only after 15 min of small usage (I was still trying to find a way to connect to my VPN), the screen frozen and the tablet became unresponsive.Too bad! I really wanted to like it.",Cheap but faulty. Not what I was expecting.
2,"The tablet was bought for a few family members, two of which have bought several Kindle books. But only the price is the only note worthy thing about it. If you buy it for 50 bucks, you have pay another 15 to remove the ads and since this is from Amazon, there is no Google Play to get more app selection.True, you can try to side load the Google Apps but the average tablet buyer won't do this. Also, the battery life is poor compared to tablets like the iPad Mini or other decent Android slates. I'd recommend a Samsung tablet or an iPad before I would recommend this, unless you have a very specific use for it and did not want to spend a lot of money.",Alright tablet for the price
2,"It works but it takes a while to do anything. But for the price, it's good enough for the kids.",It works but it's slow
2,"The price may be attractive, but not worth to buy. After seeing tabs like iPad, Nexus and others, you wouldn't be willing to use it as the display is just 1024 x 600 pixels, touch is not very smooth, not so good customized apps/games (though there is a way to install all Android apps). The build quality is good though.",Not a good tab though at a low price
2,Has tons of free games for the kids not so good for the average tablet user as its not that powerful but I guess that's only my opinion,Great for kids
2,"I looked at the reviews and they varied greatly. I didn't want an electric sharpener, so my choices were very limited. This pencil sharpener is adequate and suits my needs because I don't use pencils very often, but it is very slow and sounds like it's straining.",Fair product for the price
2,Slow with limited application. Battery doesn't last long and the download speed is less than expected.,Ok for the money but wouldnt do it over.
2,"Compared to an equally inexpensive RCA tablet, this one has more limitations in the apps you can get. I was disappointed in its utility and prefer the RCA tablet over this one.",Not a great tablet platform
2,I bought 3 of them as gifts for my nephews. It was really disapproval to learn that they were already linked to my Amazon account. I started getting notices everything's they downloaded something. I had to literally unlink everyone one of them from my account before they made a big purchase (which they did purchase Amazon Prime-which I cancelled because I wasn't ready for a $100 purchase).,Some issues
2,Was unable to get to google docs on this one even though the sales person said we would be able to. My Granddaughter needed this for school & it did not allow you to get to google docs.,Had to exchange this one
2,"It all depends on what your using a 50 dollar tablet to do is it for extreme gaming then i highly do not recommend this device. It is better for light use on the safe side use for 5h a day. 8h a day battery is the average, but runs down faster and over heats when playing a 3D game. But if u are on tight budget it is useful. ANOTHER MAJOR PROBLEM is that almost all apps that you would get on iphone and android are not availabe on the amazon fire appstore and there is no way to download them, for example clash of clans, racing rivals( which have decided to withdraw from the amazon contract and delte there game off amazons app stores). And other bigger titles omg even snapchat is not on there.",Terrible but managable
2,"The processor is very slow. The tablet is great for reading books and ordering stuff from Amazon, but it is really slow opening aps. Pay more to get the better processor.",Mediocre Tablet
2,"For the money, this tablet is an amazing piece of hardware. Well constructed, good fit and finish, good battery life.BUT putting non-Amazon software on the tablet is a pain, a real pain.I purchased this for my granddaughter and wanted two things, (1) YouTube and (2) Skype. It took about 2 hours to put these two apps on the tablet. In the end, I returned the tablet and purchased an Insignia (BB house brand) tablet instead.",If you can live within Amazon's ecosystem
2,Didn't like the return policy on this item. I couldn't purchase insurance on it in the store.,I had not had the item more than a week and it wa.
2,"I got this so my son would have something to watch movies on while on a long car trip. It does that, barely. The $50 I spent for it was worth it. If you get an SD card for it you can load and watch movies. The Wi-Fi sucks and it sometimes doesn't stream movies from Netflix. Forget about YouTube.",Not the best
2,"This version of kindle was not very impressive to me. Navigating was easier on my older kindle, this model is smaller. Also I have had an issue with charging on this device since I purchased it. When it does accept the charge it will charge to 100% rather quickly, however the battery life dies out so much faster as well. At times when I am using I will try to keep the charger connected due to this problem however it is constantly making a ""ding"" noise off and on as the charger connection does not fit well & keeps falling out. I even purchased another charger to see if this would alleviate the issue, it did not.",Prefer using previous kindle
2,This really isn't a very good tablet by any measure other than bang for your buck. I bought this for about $35 just to kill time on a couple of long flights so I didn't wear out the battery on my phone. I definitely wouldn't recommend using this for reading as the screen resolution is really below average and be tough to look at. I only used it to read some comics and play games on a screen bigger than a phone so I got what I wanted out of it.,Worth what I paid
2,"It is an ok tablet. As I am using it, I lose my page quite often and have to go back to find it again. Also, I lose internet connection or am unable to connect at all. For the money, I find it acceptable but not ideal.",Not that easily navigated.
2,I loved the kindle. But it took one small fall about 3 feet and half of the lcd screen broke. It's ruined I knew to be careful but on the first fall on wood floor???,The camera is good for the price
2,Too slow for me. You tube don't work sometimes. Able to download some books from amazon prime.,Too slow for me
2,"I've been using a Kindle forever, and when it became apparent I needed an Android device (I have a Windows phone, which I love but has serious app limitations) I thought I with a Fire I could get a tablet and upgrade my Kindle at the same time. But even with Geek Squad help I could never figure out how to upload the apps I needed onto the Fire. So back it went, replaced with a Lenovo tablet that does the trick.",Not a real tablet
2,Cheap tablet but solid built. Weak audio and poor camera.,Cheap tablet
2,I bought this tablet and returned it the same day. The only reason why I bought it in the first place was so I could play certain games with it but it turned out that the games were not supported on this device.,Nice while I had it
2,"This would be a great deal due to the good price for an better than entry level Android tablet... but... it is impossible to play music from Google play on it. Only Amazon! That's ok, since is their business, but should make that cleat to not waste time to buy and return it :(If you have a short budget and don't care about being attached to amazon only, this tablet is for you.",Nobody told it doen't like Google services.
2,"everything started out great, but then about 9 days into owning the fire, could not locate wifi, doesn't work without wifi",Started out great
2,Nothing special and not much memory but for $40 it is worth the price,Inexpensive
2,The processor was so slow. It took about five minutes to load a five minute YouTube video with 50 Mb/min. Internet.,Good for kids
2,I have been a kindle user for years and I expect a certain level of quality. This version falls short. Constantly freezes.,Dissatisfied
2,This is embarrassing. I purchased one game from amazon app store. The app crashed right away after I started it. I don't know how Amazon tested all these apps on their own device. But the experience is really bad.,Cannot play one game I purchased from Amazon Store
2,"Good value for the price, though a little slow loading some apps.",Great price
2,Took around 2 and a half days for the you tube to start the video.... But its decent enough once it started... You can never be sure when it is gonna work and when not,Decent enough for its price if it works!!!
2,"This is way to complicated for kids, my kid was frustrated trying to figure it out",Not For Kids
2,I purchased this as a after thought. The tablet has 8gb but from the moment you start to use it almost five is already used by Amazon I was totally disappointed. I love how the screen savers changed though it was so clear and unique but the memory took the cake for me!,Ugh worst ever! No memory
2,It contains too many adds that cant be removed including the lock screen its not worth the money,The amazon fire tablet 7
2,"Not much need for this thing, good price, but makes one wonder if they were on sale because they really don't do much and it would make a good gift for a youngster just getting started with a tablet. Not impressed at all.",Give away
2,"It is tough to use these tablets if you are use to Apple products. Internal memory is minimal and is taken up by all of the Amazon programs it is running. Everytime my kids play a game, the wireless connection shuts down due to running out of memory. I would not recommend these tablets for anything more that an e-book reader.",Not what we thought they were
2,Wanted a cheap tablet to read books and comics. I found the lack of apps to be disappointing. It seems the tabelt is designed to make one buy books from amazon or to buy apps.,You get what you pay for.
2,"It's cheap so I didnt expect it to be amazing, nor am I disappointed, it's great for streaming video. Even better with chromecast.",Slow Tablet
2,Didn't think it is well made the product ask for too many sign up,Didn't like the camera took bad pictures
2,Speakers sound real low Not easy to use at allHave to pay for everything,It's ok
2,Love everything about the unit except that it gets hot when used for 10 to 15 minutes. Hope it doesn't burn or explode.,Acceptable for the price
2,Purchased for my kids but it was hard to navigate and ended up with purchasing an iPad,It was average
2,"I bought this on Black Friday, simply because it was dirt cheap. It works ok but kinda slow.",Its ok for the price
2,I hope to have it set up for my disabled daughter sooon,good for beginners
2,Every time it was turned on and Every time I went to the Internet I had advertisement. If I'm going to pay money for something I certainly don't want advertisement along with it. If it were free okay fine advertise to me.The advertisement could not be shut off. I returned it.,Too much advertisement
2,"I purchased this for my husband to play his games on(clash of clans). The BB salesperson assured me he would be able to use it for that. Got it home, turns out you can only use/gets apps from the Amazon store which does not include games like clash of clans. It was already opened and set up so I gave it to my 6 yr old. He plays a few games on it and watches some movies, but would much rather play with the iPad.","So,so"
2,"We bought WowWee MiP robots for our grandsons, 8 and 11 years old. They don't have iPad or iPhone in their home. So thoroughly researched what else would work for installing the app. Talked with Best Buy salesperson, who said the app could be loaded via the app store (it can't).Kindle Fire 2015 is included on the WowWee ""compatibility"" list. So we bought them each a brand new Kindle in order to use the app. They had Kindles from earlier years, but these wouldn't support the Bluetooth functionality needed for the robots.ABSOLUTE FAIL. We tried EVERY possible configuration (adult vs child Amazon accounts; Bluetooth on first or off first; MiP on first or off first; etc). It never worked at all ~ not even once.Also tried full factory reset on each device, loading the app via a Google Play account, rather than Amazon Kindle account. Google Play wouldn't load the app; said it wasn't compatible with this Kindle device.Opened a ticket on WowWee. The response was that they've had the same experience - the bluetooth on this Kindle fails and so the app doesn't work with the WowWee robots. They admit it fails, yet it's still on their approved list.So this was an absolute waste of money, tho at least the boys can play some free games we loaded for them.",Does not work with WowWee MiP app
2,"Ok for a beginner or young person, or someone just learning the technology.",Ok for a beginner
2,Decent product. Not so much if you're used to android software. You can't get your photos saved in google. More than half of my music collection vanished once the memory card was inserted. Basicly have to hack the thing to get any apps outside of amazon and then reliability is poor. Exchanged it for am android tablet,Maybe if you like to read digital books
2,"Pros:InexpensiveExpandable storageGood for Amazon Prime members and Amazon shoppersCons:Slow/sluggish performanceLack of apps (no YouTube, Instagram etc)Some available apps crash or can not be installedTouch screen freezesScreen resolution is not sharp or bright, greenish hueToo many links/ads to buy thingsSound quality is not goodWiFi onlyConclusion:For the price the Amazon Fire 7 Tablet is good for those who want an eReader that can also access email, Facebook and Amazon Prime but the lack of apps, cheap construction and buggy performance keep it from being a good, full-featured tablet.","As they say, you get what you pay for"
2,"The resolution on the games is not good. I didn't even try to watch Netflix because i knew it wouldn't show clearly. Also, it is slow using the internet. I assumed it would look and work like Android but i wrong. Everything is Amazon which i am unfamiliar with. Honestly, it is better for reading books. I returned for something more diverse and better.",Awesome for avid book readers
2,"Bought this tablet this Thanksgiving for $35.Tablet is too slow and apps doesn't responds properly, tried doing the updates over wifi to see if that resolves the issue but that didn't work too.Commons apps like Gmail, Facebook, Messenger or browser related are dying very frequently and sometimes doesn't even boots up, also, coming from Android you will feel that you have landed up in a deserted apps land.A good tablet for kids but adults can't rely on it !",Price is good but not worth !
2,"I didn't expect a lot at this price, but I also did not expect both of my tablets to be riddled with dead/stuck pixels right out of the box. I have a third arriving in the mail and am just praying that I am at least good for 1/3. Waiting on its arrival before doing the trip for return/replacement just in case that one needs to go as well. Maybe just bad luck, but definitely worth noting for anyone who may also be inconvenienced by having to do a return.Everything else seems good though when you can look past the display issues, but may be worth waiting until these defective lots have been disbursed and the issues have been corrected.I am sure if you don't have these display issues that the product deserves more than 2 stars, but if you can see things from my perspective it is kind of difficult to recommend this to anyone for the time being. If the display did not have these pixel issues I could see this easily being a 4 Star recommendation. If you do a little research you will see that there are definitely some lot numbers that are more problematic than others, so this is not just a rare incident. If it is for you and you plan to grab one from a brick and mortar location, do yourself a favor and just boot it up before you drive home. :)",Dead/Stuck Pixels Galore!
2,Ok tablet...decent size screen & graphics. Was hoping I could mirror my phone to it but it doesn't have miracast.,Good tablet for kids
2,Not happy that the product had no instruction book to go with it to help set it up. Not a big fan of the online tutorial. Had a really hard time in powering it off. Camera setting did not take very good pictures. DID NOT LIKE THE MULTIPLE ADS ON IT EVERY TIME I USED IT. FINALLY IT LOCKED UP ON ME AND I HAD A HARD TIME GETTING IT TO GO TO SETTINGS SO I COULD DO ANYTHING WITH IT. Probably will be returning this product to Best Buy.,Not happy with the overall performance of product.
2,This product is a beginner product for Kids and nothing to be of use for Elders,Product for Kids and not for Elders
2,"First, bought it 15 days before it went on sale everywhere. Next, store doesn't tell you about all the ads offers that come with it and you must pay $15 to disable them. Performance is slow; keypad is slow, am typing faster than it can register resulting in lots of typos. Watching movies is decent, but sound could be better. It drops WiFi more than I'm used to. Have several apps that cannot be installed on it and a few that consistently crash. Good battery kifre, but Quite slow to recharge. Sometimes the ""keys"" stick and can't get out of something even with home key, must restart. Thought this would be cheap temporary solution but this is better served by my 5 year old grandson.I got $50 worth of tablet.Compared to the look and feel of my old iPad, its like I'm still using a VCR and everyone else is on blue ray.",Exactly $50 worth of tablet
2,just bought it and not really happy i really expected more from amazon,good price
2,"Apps run okay but the real problem is streaming and internet browsing. I'm telling you, generic tablets are faster... I thought it was my internet at first but all my other devices work phenomenally fast. I first noticed this after I started using it but I thought I would give it a shot. I've decided to return this and exchange for another $50 tablet tomorrow. This is because I couldn't even watch a simple youtube video today.Here's what I did like. It's name brand. The games are nice and mostly ad free. It uses Android 5.0 but uses their own app store. Reading books is great. Library app is kinda slow but still works.Perfect cheap tablet for kids age 6 to 13 maybe...",A nice tablet for books. That's really it.
2,the tablet is certainly a good value but the wifi signal drops frequently and even when it shows its connected can fail to download any data. Perhaps this is a glitch that will be fixed in a later SW update but for now I have to say the performance is underwhelming. the Backlight also has some serious bleed issues which is a sign of an inferior design and or workmanship. The fire 7 HD which i also own has none of these issues. Get what you pay for rings true again.,Cheap but appears Wifi is inadequate
2,"The Fire 7 has a great price! You get your money's worth. However, you may have to do an exchange if you get a damaged one. The one I bought had a busted pixel in the screen. There was no damage to the case or glass screen, but the image had a bright white puncture hole in the screen's image. I've owned multiple, but I have never had this problem before with an ePad tablet when I just bought it. I will now have to visit Best Buy again tomorrow for an exchange. I'm hoping they're still in stock. It's not Best Buy's fault. The fault lies with Amazon. They're clearly not that durable.",Damaged Screen
2,I got this to replace the iPad for a child. I am so disappointed by the charge. It dies so quickly and the charger has to be wrapped around the tablet in order for it to charge. This was after 2 weeks of having the tablet. Low price but not worth the hassle and disappointment!,Disappointed
2,Bought this for my daughter and she didn't care for it when it came to the apps. Works great for reading.,Slow tablet
2,very slow device for most adults. probably fine for a child,very slow
2,Use it a lot for listening to audio books. Too many ads.,OK - wish it didn't have all the ads
2,"My granddaughter used her phone constantly to play games and when she needed to make a call phone is dead. Now with tablet, she FaceTime me more and her phone now keep a chatge.",Excellent game for 8year old
2,The battery is having more and more trouble holding a charge. I bought the Fire in July and am now having to charge it every day in order to use it. I am not impressed and would not repurchase it.,The size is great for taking on the road
2,Wasnt really impressed with the operating system. Was hoping it was more of android style. Not so much.,Operating system.
2,Kindle is good as long as it is plugged into a wall outlet. The battery lasts a mere 15 minutes as a portable unit. Not happy with this. Takes an hour to charge the battery to 100% yet drains in 15 minutes. There`s something mathematically wrong with this equation.,Good as long as it is plugged in to outlet.
2,"Bought this for my toddler to watch his shows on netflix amazon and vudu. Vudu isnt compatable, netflix is so slow it kept buffering, so he got upset. Acording to its specs it has a faster processing system than my linsay tablet bit its five times slower atleast. Downloading anything takes forever. It was also very difficult to navigate.Over all waste of money",Piece of junk
2,Bought it accidentally. Meant to get an 8 inch screen.,Too small
2,"Hard to use, Lots of ads, and Randomly closes apps",Not a huge fan
2,"It is too heavy for its size! I purchased it to replace a larger Nook, and find that it weighs as much. Screen is attractive but it even with a good signal in public places, hanging on to Wifi is difficult. It is not efficient when downloading (buffering, buffering...) and I am still debating returning it for another tablet.","I bought it for travel, but barely used it."
2,"Hi,I ordered this for my daughter who has an extensive liking of tablets. She didnt like it because of lack of google play services and she didnt have the patience to work with it. I knew that the os is only amazon specific but despite the apps that can be downloaded, she was disappointed. I returned it.If you are an avid amazon person, the tablet works great, if you want a google tablet, this isn't for you. I would recommend these for people that want a good decent tablet that they can read and use amazon apps on.",Its gd if you like amazon
2,Amazon fire is a good tablet if you like e-books. It's also nice to get a six-month subscription to the Washington Post. Their claim to have 16 gigabytes of storage is misleading because it only gives you 5 and then they want to charge you the same amount of money that you paid for the tablet for unlimited storage. Another problem is that you can't flag something as being inappropriate like you can on Samsung Galaxy tablets.,Okay tablet
2,It's a good device for children because they don't know any better,Good for kids
2,"Just got this today and have been struggling with a few things. Set up itself was pretty easy right oit of the box. Had no idea I would not have access to Google Play Store. Beware, there is a much more limited selection of apps available for this device. Browsing is slow, even while in the same room with my modem. Much slower than my phone or my other tablet. Tumblr app, though able to be downloaded, malfunctions consistently. Will probably return this and get a more capable tablet, but will give it another couple of days to get used to it before doing so.","Slow, Not enough apps, Tumblr Doesn't work"
2,"Loved my husbands 4th generation disappointed in my 5th generation. 4th generation has 2 speakers and sound is much louder than the current 5th generation. I purchased this expecting the same quality in sound, or better, since I use the kindle to watch my TV shows.",Disappointed
2,I can't update Facebook and a few other apps. It's not what I expected.,Not what I need.
2,I purchased this tablet a week ago as a gift for my brother and it has restarted itself over ten times and has shut off while someone was on in on different occasions Will be getting my money back and getting a samsung..,No good
2,"Can't really give a full review since the Kindle Fire seemed to work properly, however, the security, Webroot Anywhere, that was included was impossible to install. I tried calling Geek Squad 4 times for support and was disconnected EVERY time. I finally went to store for instructions which they printed off but still would not download. I've ended up buying an iPad which is fantastic and would not buy again from BestBuy.",Unfortunate
2,"The tablet works great when the battery is charged. The problem we have is the provided charging cable connector does not seat well into the tablet's micro USB port and does not have a solid electrical connection. Therefore, most of the time the tablet sits useless with a dead battery.",Tablet will not charge

2,"I don't want to get too negative on this, because it does what it's supposed to. However, I'm not sure how Amazon justifies charging 40! Half that and I'd feel a lot less disappointed. It's nothing like the last generation cover, which was hefty and substantial. That thing could take a beating! This one Umm...not so much.PROS:- I really like the solution Amazon came up with to lock the Kindle in place sort of a rubberized cup that grips it on all four sides and holds it VERY securely. No more metal-prong slide-release gizmo.- It looks quite nice and is genuine (if untextured) leather like the last one.CONS:- Flimsy. The leather is extremely thin and unpadded. Won't stand up to much abuse. scrape it even lightly on a rough surface and you'll likely ruin it.- The actual cover that folds over the front is incredibly floppy and delicate -- it's about the thickness of a piece of notepad cardboard. I could bend it in half with almost no effort, if I had the notion.- Cover has no lock/closure mechanism (like the elastic strap on the last gen model). It should have SOMETHING.Oh, well. It is what it is. I never read with the Kindle in the case anyway so it's not such a big deal to me, but I was expecting more. Especially for this price!","Does the job, but way overpriced"
2,"This is a good tablet for children and adults too. However there is an issue with the port and charger cable. We did not even have this tablet 3 weeks before it would barley charge. Took it back to best buy and they said they could not fox it, and imagine the port is not covered under the manufacturer warranty. So now I have a tablet that takes a couple days to charge. Its really frustrating.",Nice but problematic
2,The charging plugs on these kindle damage way to easy. I am very disappointed as this is not the first time this has happened to one of my kindles.,Charging plug
2,"So I bought my little guys these tablets... so that I could repossess my IPad. Love the free time app but who could've imagined they wouldn't play NETFLIX!! So now... I'm out the money for the tablet and still don't have my iPad back... and yes, I called Amazon numerous times... they work after the fix, but the next time they go to use them they don't work again... the fix takes several minutes as it's force stopping the app, clearing cache then doing a hard restart... then you have to wait to restart Netflix.... oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous times before it works... if it works at all",Disappointed doesn't play Netflix

2,"I have to say this was not that great a purchase and we will most likely be taking advantage of it's greatest product feature, which is the ability to return it for a full refund. We wanted a smaller tablet for our kids, well this is smaller in every way, options are limited and we have realized that we are better off just letting the kids use our tablet so we can buy the newest one. This thing may go back to the store as soon as tonight.","I expected limitations, I got limitations"
2,I bought this tablet for my son and I don't like it. The touch screen is very poor quality. It's hard to move things around on it when he is playing a game. He prefers my iPad than to use his own. I know the iPad quality is probably the best quality but it's way under that! Very frustrating. Will be returning it.,POOR QUALITY
2,"Not sure why, but it kept freezing and ended up having to return it. Very disappointing",Kept freezing
2,"I am disappointed that this is not more toddler friendly. It is a kindle inside a kid proof case. You have to set up child locks, etc. My biggest complaint is most of the games that are available you have to be connected to the internet.

Nice looking product, however, very little storage space.... after downloading a few apps... the storage was full and was required to buy more! Also, cannot play videos unless hooked up to wifi. Unlike the sales associate told me. Very disappointing!!! Would not recommend!",Disappointing product.
2,Slow processor equates to slow internet browsing. User I nterface is ok. Really wish it had the capability to lock onto the movie screen while my toddler watches movies. Next time I'll just spend the additional money on an iPad mini for my kids.,Just ok...
2,When i purchased 2 if them i assumwd it would be kid friendly. Its fill with tons of bloat wear. The opening screen has about 15 -20 apps. It worse than a normal adult tablet. my kids dont use it at all because we have to unlock it for them everytime then open the kids app. Then we have to hover over them to help them ever step of the way.,not kid friendly
2,"I received an email asking if I would like to give my review and I am glad that I did. I purchased this less than 2 months ago and it has already quit working. It will not charge and it will no longer power on. All I have is a black screen. When it did work, it dropped internet quite frequently and froze several times during use. I would not recommend this product.",Very disappointed

2,The tablet itself works fine but this is the 2nd one I have gotten with a similar problem. The port seems to come defected. The charger doesn't stay in and it takes a long time to charge. Replaced charger with a brand new one and it still has issues.,Not as happy as I thought
2,"Got this for my 8yo daughter. A lot of the times it doesn't work, I have to restart it a lot, and it only has 3 apps that I added on it. It came with way too many pre-loaded apps, and the most annoying thing is that the kids profile is permanently horizontal.

I had to go through being on hold FOREVER to get someone to help get this off my device so that was an IMMEDIATE turn-off.

So this would only allow you to buy at most four books at a time before the covers would be too small. The new books should be downloaded to my Library in List Form as in the original Kindle. In addition, once you have looked at a book in the homepage, it disappears and you have to search for it or place it in a category. Finally, this system disallows you from manipulating books the way you want. This OS is definitely NOT USER FRIENDLY. It requires a great deal of effort of the user.

Not sure if it is the Amazon Fire box itself or if it is the TV (Not likely).Otherwise it is a good device. I bought it for the ability to hard wire my Ethernet connection to my gigabit switch and for 4K capabilities which it does do.

I'd switch artists and it'd happen again. I contacted Amazon, and was told not to request artists. I needed to specify albums and songs. I don't have this info memorized. I bought it to say artist names. Someone responding to my poor review on Amazon suggested trying different music services. I dumped Amazon music and started requesting music on Pandora. Alexa misunderstood my granddaughters request, and played Christmas music on Pandora, although we were now well into Jan. I'm no longer having the Christmas music problem, but Alexa is just ok playing music from Pandora. Sometimes it gets it right, sometimes not.

2,This device is not as great as advertised. It does not do as many things as expected and you have to go to a lot of trouble to do otherwise,Thought it would be better
2,Thought this would be pretty cool gadget. Not impressed. Poor voice recognition.,Not impressed
2,Not very functional and never had all the answers I needed. And I wanted a device I could make phone calls to anyone with in which the Google home does. We purchased the Google home and we are so glad we did.,Not as smart as Google

2,"The one thing i had an issue with,is I would leave my amazon speaker on playing since it's always listening. But,at times it would just cut off by itself,without my command. Another issue would be if I'm on the phone and what I'm saying may sound close to the command according to the speaker itself, it would automatically light up for me to command it to do something. Don't know if i like the idea of it listening all the time.",Gets very loud.
2,Could answer weather questions but struggled to answer anything else. Bought it for my father who is blind. Bing search engine terrible.,Bing search engine.
2,"A wonderfully designed device, but its use is fairly limited. I bought it primarily to use as a Smart Home control device. However, although it allows you to turn on and off lights, you cannot add timers to the control instructions. For instance, you cannot tell the Echo to turn off a light in 30 minutes; you can only tell it to turn it off or on immediately. Finding that out was incredible disappointing. I don't know understand why it would be so hard to add such a feature.","No Bluetooth is a bummer, no on/off timers"
2,"I have two Google home devices. They seem to be lacking in smart5 home controls. Now I find out that additional devices are necessary to use Echo in a smarthome configuration. Although currently somewhat limited, I expect that Google home will surpass the Echo with addon smarthome devices.

I returned this one and purchased the ""Google"" and this one is much better and more knowledgeable with answers.

I didn't expect additional charges and so I'm not to thrilled with either one but I did keep the Google device in hopes of better to come in the future.",Not Knowledgable
2,I thought this product would be a lot better than it is. It is not as smart as they say it is. It has a long way to go.,Disappointed
2,Alexa has a hard time answering. You need to download information online in order to build her data base.,Not the best option.
2,Honestly I see no difference in this and the iPhone.,Good Speaker
2,Concerns about syncing our phones to Echo and difficulty loading music was a deal breaker. Maybe its operator error. Not for us.,Not what we expected.
2,I returned this to the store cuz I realised I didn't need music or lighting control. I replaced it with the echo dot. Disappointed because didn't know I needed wifi which I don't have.,Took back and got the echo dot

2,It's a nice idea if you have a need for such a gadget. My opinion was it wasn't worth the money. Computers and smart phones do mostly the same thing so why have an additional gadget. It might be more worthwhile for someone that wants to use it for running smart gadgets around the house. Not for me so I returned it.,It's a nice idea if you need it
2,I had a hard time trying to work this it could not understand me most of the time everything seem to be hard to work for me.,It was hard for me to work.
2,"I received this as a Christmas gift. I was excited about this new product and downloaded the Alexa App. I am not an Amazon Prime member and I did not joined the free trial. I asked questions to my Alexa and it usually did not provide any answers, or couldn't understand my questions despite giving simple commands. The device looks good and the LED light on top that turns on when you speak to it is great. Sound is good for music. However, I did not feel that it was a good assistant. I did not like that you have to download skills to make Alexa have more function. You always had to speak Alexa, and then ask the skill you downloaded. It then gets to a point that you don't even remember what skills you downloaded so you always had to look at your phone or mobile device to see what you had. I exchanged it for the Google Home and it has been a better device. It plays music from Google Music and not only music that you have purchased. It answer a lot of questions and gives you great news briefing instead of downloading the particular skills. It also provides more answers to questions and I was surprise by the detail of the answer at time. I highly recommend to Google Home device. I have not tested it with chromecast, Smart TV, or with Smart home appliances such as Nest, etc.",Does basic functions but not what I expected.
2,"When I first saw this product it was a must have for me. I researched this product for weeks and was happy with what I had read. After getting the product home I must say it was OVER RATED!.

Took some getting use to for me to get the commands right to change my nest thermostat. Must use the app to install 3rd party skills to the app to control smart devices.,Not all what I expected. Siri answers better.
2,We returned this item after 2 weeks. It took a lot of repeated request to get it to listen to us and it just wasn't as easy to use as I thought it would be.,Fun (when it worked)
2,Wasn't what I thought it would be. Not a good investment.,Echo
2,"Alexa is tall, slim and attractive but too jealous to use Google and that makes her rather dumb. And she is just a shill for Amazon prime. Dropping the personification, music volume changes annoyingly with different songs and over time. The database Amazon Echo draws from is very limited: Alexa can tell you what the weather is but not what the most common woman's shoe size is; what Serena Williams' age is but not how many guns Ruger sold last year. Stand by for more tech-savvy companies to take the Echo concept to maturity.",Good Music Fidelity & Voice Recognition
2,Not what I expected .. This thing pretty much runs according to skills & not just ask a question & it searches the Internet. I find Siri much better because it does search the net. I can ask the same question the same way & you always get an answer with Siri but not with Alexia. It always say I do not understand the question. Again this thing needs much improvement & it's not worth the price tag especially when Siri is included with my iPhone.,Still needs improvements
2,I think Ok Google can do the same or more. I found annoying by saying Amazon or other echo names repeatedly to get some answers if you get them. May be in future I may try when it is more practical,Good Idea but far from practical use.
2,"Not sure what all the hype is about, this AI is remedial at best. It responds with the exact same answer to vastly different questions. Not intuitive at all. Save your money.",Extreme Disappointment
2,"I was hoping for a 'google' experience, but it isn't there yet. There is a lot of questions that it can't answer. I hope, and expect it to get better. The music player is a nice feature that I use frequently.",I expected it to be better
2,My hubby bought this for me since I was constantly googling questions on my phone. I was so excited to start asking it questions..... the only problem is Alexa doesn't have any of the answers. Music sounds great on it but that's about it. Not impressed. Save your money.,Over priced blue tooth speaker
2,I am not impressed at all I think you should save your money and get a smart watch instead. This is a expensive item and doesn't do enough for the money you spent. The weather timers adding things to your calendar that's just not enough half the things you ask her she said she doesn't understand,Not impressed
2,"I really liked the idea of having a device I could talk to out of nowhere that would answer (although our cells phones can do similarly, but you have to turn them on and press buttons, etc.). It is also gratifying to be able to tell a device to play music and it does. I was quite disappointed in the ability of Alexa to answer any serious questions. Jeff needs to pay to send his programmers back to search school. So many times Alexa says a phrase similar to I don't understand the question So basically I paid for a radio. I paid extra for the larger one, but the output is still no different than a clock radio. Come on Amazon!!!",Amazon Echo falls short of expectations
2,Crazy that you have to buy these separate for some kindle products that should come with one,works

It doesn't stand in any position, so I can't use my 6 hands free. It also doesn't line up properly when closed, so the Fire seems to come out of sleep mode, thus draining the battery more quickly. And finally, I have discovered that I do prefer the leather covers over whatever material this is made from. I understand that the cost of a leather case would probably be half the cost of the Kindle Fire HD 6...not that this case was any bargain at 30!!",Not an Impressive Case One person found this helpful.

2,I was not overly impressed with this system. I didn't realize you have to buy Amazon prime in order to use the functions. It didn't connect easily to my phone. It wouldn't just stream music saved on my iPhone. I had to download a music app and then load my music into the app. It wouldn't work. Way too much work and added expenses in order to use. Wasn't happy with that so I returned it and purchased a jbl portable Bluetooth speaker.,I returned this product
2,I was quite disappointed when I began working through the menus and discovered that my 2 year old Roku 3 was far more intuitive. Roku also allows searches of all of your subscribed services. If I am already paying a subscription fee to Netflix or HBO NOW and I can watch a tv show or movie without additional cost why should I pay Amazon to watch it?

It's nice when it works but I had problems with it that caused me to return it.I have a Fire Stick and it works great. I leave it plugged in but it needs to be unplugged every few weeks, otherwise it works fairly well. The Fire TV had to be unplugged after every use. The screen would flash and sometimes there would be a popping sound. If I left it plugged in for any amount of time, then it would not work well. I liked the voice search on it and Alexa works great. You can ask for the weather, play music, and presumably other things that the Echo, Dot, and Tap can do. Just a side note, you have to keep the button pressed when asking Alexa to do something.Maybe I had a defective unit, maybe it was something else. But I've had a Paperwhite and a Voyage that both died on me in similar ways. I've never had a problem with the lower end Kindles or Fire tablets.

2,"I own a high end system with AppleTV 3 and Chromcast media players for Netflix and the likes. I purchased fire tv for 4K. As with other devices I thought I could configure it and forget it. This is not the case with Fire TV. Remote control requires constant attention. Open the back play with batteries, but battery cover back on. Constantly! HDMI port does not work with HDMI switch. It is the only device that I own that does not play well with my switch. Internet connection is poor. Start receiving video won't load errors after a week. I thought perhaps WiFi connection was bad even though no other device had this issue, so I tried wired connection and got same error. Tried restarting it more than any device should need but this did not help. Device is very hot. It is on constantly. No automatic method of turning off when not being used.On the plus side, the interface is the best I seen on any media player. Beautiful picture and screen saver which can be configured. Alexia rocks but limited to basic commands. Amazon Prime integration is excellent as you might expect. Beautiful looking device. After about 10 days I got fed up and returned it. I'll wait for AppleTV to integrate 4K. Hopefully that will be soon.",Drama Queen
2,"Pros:- Amazon Prime works on it.- You can still sideload apps, like Kodi.Cons:- Not a good upgrade over the original Fire TV, is worse in some aspects.- Remote buttons are hard to press (compared to original Fire TV)- Remote loses connection frequently and takes several button presses or removing of the remote batteries to fix- Interface isn't as snappy as the original Fire TV- Same interface as the original Fire TV: There's still no good way to sort your apps or locate the Prime content that you want.- Voice search seems about the same as the original Fire TV. Alexa adds nothing significant. You still can't use it to search in 3rd party apps, like Youtube.- As for video decoding in Kodi, performance isn't much better than the original Fire TV. You will be able to play HEVC content at 1080p with no problem, but 1080p .264 hi10p (software-decoded) does not play well. There's simply not enough power. 4k decoding is hit-and miss. It needs to be specifically coded for this Fire TV (low bitrate, low fps) to work properly.- Overall system performance is bad. When sitting idle, the CPUs spike up to 60% usage and memory is at 60% usage. The OS is not well-optimized.I'm not confident that Amazon can fix these issues in a timely manner and their competitors are releasing their media players soon, so I'll likely return this while I still can.",For dedicated Amazon Prime users only
2,"It's somewhat of a step up from the Roku 3 I was previously using, but not as much as I was expecting. I think it's a couple firmware updates away from being better than it is now.Spent the good part of the day trying to figure out why I could only connect to my dual-band router at 2.4GHz and not 5GHz. 1.5 hours on the phone with Verizon FiOS tech support was unsuccessful as other devices connected at 5GHz without issue. Was about to pack it up and return it until I called Amazon tech support. Turns out it's a known-issue that the FireTV has difficulty with 5GHz networks that are set to auto channel selection and are utilizing channel numbers above 100.The tech support person said I should change the channel to 36, 44, or 48 instead of automatic, and, it worked.Bluetooth audio and video are out of sync with Showtime, Netflix, Sling, Plex and Hulu. It's fine through speakers, but video lags slightly behind the audio using Bluetooth. Audio and video are in perfect sync with Bluetooth and Amazon Prime Video which makes me think it'll be fixed at some point, as Amazon provided video demonstrates it can work well in that regard.Gotta say I prefer the platform agnostic UI of Roku, with Amazon-world tucked away in an app. The FireTV navigation pane represents mostly Amazon products with no option to modify it. Roku's UI is more about the media, less about the provider. Voice search works well if you want only to be presented with Amazon's viewing options, for some reason I thought search was universal, but only movies and TV shows available through Amazon show up. Bummer :-(The FireTV-2 is OK, less than I was expecting and with other good options around the corner, I'm beginning to doubt my choice...",Almost...
2,For a device with 4k Technology they don't seem to advertise it much. You can barely see it on the box. Also search feature only works for Amazon. That's a waste of a search feature.

3,"This was a good tablet. I bought it for my Gf who basically only wanted it for Netflix and YouTube. The display was good, not great. The issue we had was that it kept dropping the wifi connection. This could have been a defect in this one tablet but we returned it and got another one.",Good tablet bad wifi connection
3,"This tablet is great for books, audible books, music and all things Amazon. The included browser (Silk) is not the best. I purchased expanded memory (64GB SD card) for about $30 more and a cover for about $20. The biggest issue I have with this unit is that it is slow (when compared to an iPad) and it tends to freeze every so often. For about 2.5x more money, consider an iPad instead.",Not an iPad by any means
3,"Worse graphics, won't keep a wireless connection,overall not satisfied",Not like the older model
3,"Not very fancy, but not slow. If you have Amazon Prime, you have a access to a great library of TV shows and Movies for free. Same goes for free book rentals. The Amazon App store is not so great, lots of apps are outdated but still work. Just not the latest versions you would expect. But the Amazon Underground appstore does offer free access to games you would normally pay for. It's decent for it's price and a good deal if you don't want anything fancy.",Good tablet for what it does
3,"I know beforehand that this is not a powerful tablet. But it's the best bargain at this price point . The screen is okay if you just read books, news, or surf the websites. But if you want to enjoy videos-this is not your choice.The processor is slow and the amazon app store doesn't have all the apps like you'd expect from Google appstore- even though the OS based on android. But few tweaks let you install the Google playstore-search online for the steps.Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase. Hope this is helpful.",Gets the work done
3,It is just an average tablet. Bit slow but is a good option for people on budget,Just ok
3,Tablet stopped working after owning for two weeks. Came back on after an hour.,Amazon
3,"This tablet is definitely recommended if you are looking for light to medium usage. Tablet is snappy and quick but slarts to lag after installing multiple apps.Amazon app store is good but there are few essential apps that are not available, though you can install them using black market.",Decent for the price
3,It all of a sudden has stoped charging I have only used it a few times in the short time off purchase. Can I get a replacement or how best can I be helped,Sad
3,"like it at first, but it is going slow sometimes. overall good product",good
3,"This is the second Fire tablet that I have purchased. The first I returned in after I was not able to load YouTube onto the tablet. Amazon's take on Android was just to unfriendly to make it work. With this new tablet, Amazon has heard my concern and now I'm enjoying this tablet. It's well built for a sub-$100 device, but won't stand up to a lot of abuse.",Better than before
3,Need to have some computer savvy. Wound be much more helpful if it came with a simple basic instructions.,Not for computer beginner
3,the first worked fine for three weeks then stopped. took back and got a replacement. this one lasted almost a month. again took it back and was told I had to deal with Amazon.Found out thru Amazon webpage that units simply froze up and how to reset it. Was upset that store associate knew nothing about the product. Had to research everything myself.,stopped working after 3 weeks.
3,ok for price a little slow and doesn't have as many apps as google play.,good for price
3,I didn't do any in depth research on this particular tablet. The price and speed were good for what I wanted it for. My only con is not being able to clear the home screen of apps or relocate them so I can see my personal home screen picture.,Great tablet for speed
3,"For the price it can't be beat. That being said I had to return mine after a week. I just couldn't get over the low resolution screen. It works well for movies and the Web, but I needed it to also show off my photos to others.",Amazon is amazing
3,Bought the fire for my mother who is 72 to learn how to use a computer the price was right and she can use it to search the web,Great for learning to use computer
3,"I have had every version of the Kindle since the week it was introduced and jumped at the chance for a Kindle Fire. I replaced the first one I had in 2014 and it was everything I wanted except this past summer it started overheating and got nonresponsive in the midday heat. So...I got this one. First of all I miss Swype. WHY get rid of it? Secondly I cannot put two of my favorite apps (which work on my old one) to work on this but lastly and most importantly: every once in awhile the screen freezes with a bunch of code ""shimmering"" in the background and only turning it off and/or leaving it for awhile brings it back to life AND it turns itself off. It seems to happen when I close a program and move to a new one. Aggravating and not what I expect from a product with which I have been happy in the past.",Not ad happy with this one by far
3,"Wry basic, but I guess, it's ok for the price. Bought for a 6 year old.",Very basic
3,Bought as gift for senior. Setup process could be easier.,Overall nice display; email setup not so friendly

3,"This is good for kids. Cheap enough that if they destroy it, you won't get upset",Adequate entry level tablet
3,Would recommend for the right person that wants low cost tablet BUT...Ended up returning this item because it was heavy and too wide for my hand to hold. It was too big to hold in hand and too small to use like a larger tablet. Ended up just using my Lenovo Yoga 900 since it was more flexible and only about .5 lb heavier.,ok tablet
3,Very helpful and friendly. Didn't have too much selection on what I was looking for. But found what I needed.,Found what I needed.
3,Was looking for a cheap tablet for my a son to use saw this unit on sale on black Friday good unit.,Fire Tablet
3,I gave this as a gift for Christmas and still can't get it set up will have to go to geek squad to help,Hard to set up
3,"I bought the 8"" version on impulse because of an excellent offer on Black Friday. As an Amazon product, it offers Amazon apps. While you can get Google Play apps, it requires some hoops. I just discovered I can't save movies from Netflix because that only applies to the HDX version. So this product has limits. But used as a Kindle reader, or to get email via wifi, or other uses (wifi only) while traveling where you wouldn't want to take an expensive device, it is a good choice.",Kindle Fire HD Just OK
3,"This Kindle was purchased on the black friday sale. At the time I felt it was a steal at that price. The first tablet I purchased a few years ago was the original Kindle Fire, the following year I purchased an iPad mini and now have the iPad mini 4. As you may already know, the iPad does not have explandable memory. This Kindle can have expanded memory to 200GB so that was a good selling point for me. After setting this new Kindle Fire up, I noticed that viewing photos were not as clear as the original iPad mini even without retina display, and the color had a greenish-yellowish tint to it. Some may not notice this if they do not have something else to compare it to. I'm a pro photographer so this was quite unaceptable to me. I was not expecting perfection with the colors but people's skin tones appeared greenish as if they were Vulcans. I also like to read tech manuals and magazines of which many are in PDF format. The Kindle will read this format but the Kindle Fire after all these years still cannot display the cover art from pdf books, etc.; it displays an acrobat pdf document logo instead. If you have a large library of pdfs you have to read through the document titles instead of being able to select by seeing the cover of the book. That was enough for me, I've been spoiled by the ease of use of the iPad and the display with accurate colors. Back to the store for a prompt refund it went. Overall..still a good deal but if you are used to an iPad for the reasons I am..you may be disappointed.",Just ok for the price
3,"Works well. But does not offer access to the apple or android App Store. Without the apps that I need, this tablet is not as useful.",Still prefer iPad or android tablet
3,Works well but lacks forward control of screen and right and left movement on keyboard. Good foor short notes but could never do any substantial typing on this without external keyboard. Good for basic websurfing and email.,Size and price good.
3,bought this during black friday (actually Thursday). ok for price. but not cool i had to buy extra storage for not a great price.,ok
3,"Hoped this Fire HD 8 would be faster than my old HD Fire...not so much, I guess I expected the new Fire HD 8 to perform better but it still lags and is slow to load information while surfing the Internet. My wife's Ipad is light years ahead on this one, but what do you expect from a 60-70 dollar tablet.",Nice screen resolution.
3,This is an older tablet. I probobly expected too much. If I'm going to deal with lagginess I prefer my ipad2.,"Not bad, just not my flavor of android."
3,Does everything I need thank you. Alight small package easy to take anywhere,Perfect
3,Best gift for Beginers. Less Price and enough speed and memory. Kids like it a lot.,Best gift for Beginers
3,works great for the price.but it shoves amazon stuff down your hroat like the fire tv.and is linked to your amazon 1 click buy if you haveit set up that way.,soso
3,Nice tablet for the price. Just wish it had bluetooth.,Not bad
3,my kids have this. it works okay for things like youtube or netflix. Apps take longer to load and many games that you can get for the iPad aren't available on the Fire Tablet. Still say go with Mac.,it's ok
3,"The camera is not very sharp , and you can not download another one .",Not a very good camera .
3,Nice tablet but as usual with these items no instructions on how to get started,Not so much
3,"Ok tablet from amazon, added Google play to device for more apps. Google how to do this.",Fast but screen not as big as ipad mini
3,"still playing with it, figuring out what I can & can't do. I love the tangerine color I got. One thing for sure, some apps I have on my phone like redbox & instagram they are not in the amazon app store so I can't put them on the tablet. Wish I could.",Still figuring it out
3,"I really wanted to give this device a chance but I did end up returning it. It's a HUGE upgrade though over the cheaper 7"" version. Honestly I don't think anyone should purchase that. If your budget can handle getting this version and you are heavily invested in the Amazon ecosystem (i.e. Prime member) this will make a great tablet. I think it is intended more for kids though than adults. Having iPads in the house we tried this with our toddler as a cheaper tablet for her but the interface and quirks of the Amazon OS just were not worth the hassle. Will end up seeking out a used iPad Mini 2 instead of this.",It's pretty average for what you are paying
3,At this price point it is very good. But having being used ipad the display doesnt look sharp. Amazon app store lacks content. Overall good for my 9 yr old.,Good but...
3,upgraded my 3 year old kindle- same old. doesnt seem that great of a difference. the graphical interface still sucks but its decent for reading.,basic kindle
3,"Its cheap, but the you will notice the low screen resolution compared to iPad. App is somewhat limited unless you side load it.",Nice Basic tablet
3,I'm disappointed that it doesn't have a mirror display mode.,"It's an ok tablet, but very limited in apps."
3,"I like this tablet. I had a nook, the fire has more memory, bigger screen and lower price. The downside? The Amazon Fire is so ridiculously proprietary that I cannot watch any of my movies on it from my nook. This is becoming industry standard. Too bad.",Burned by fire
3,Battery lasts a long time but I actually like my old Fire more.,It's ok
3,"My 5 yr old loves it, however we do experience some sound issues from time to time.",Great xmas gift

3,"I previously owned the Fire HD 7 and was excited about the HD 8. After getting the HD 8 and using it I started to notice how they were able to cut costs.

3,Got this for my 10 year old grandson. He really likes it a lot. This is good for kids to learn responsibility using tablets.,Great table for children
3,Overall this is a great product. It sometimes freezes with some of the games but other apps work great. Alexa is a great addition.,Great tablet for the price
3,"The built quality is great taking into considerarions its price. The tablet is pretty fast and responsive. However, Amazon's operating system is horrible. I miss a lot of apps that I use in my Apple devices, and some others that just don't work as good such as Mint and Netflix (don't have download capability). Also it won't work with my Chromecast devices...","Good hardware, bad software"
3,This is a good tablet for basic use. I ened up returning it and going with an iPad which met my needs more. This tablet would be good for someone with limited computer knowledge/use.,Great basic tablet

We did ask if it had those features and was told yes but I think we need to have a special app. Why isn't there a manual or step by step guide on getting the most use out of Kindle Fire 8. Can I get it online? Kindle Fire 8 fun to use but needs more info for customers. Can we go to a class at Best Buy? Thanks for any help.",Need guide/instructions

3,"As a low priced 8"" tablet, it has a good display, good speed, and reasonable battery life.I am a bit peeved by the rather intrusive adds that Amazon pushes onto it.I am also unhappy that I cannot load all the apps I am used to using on my Android phone.

3,"I had to sideload google play services to be able to download from the google play store or use google chrome as a web browser, as this tablet was designed to be exclusive to Amazon.","not bad, but..."
3,Thought it was to be better than what it is. Mother in law can play games an Facebook on it. Next time I will buy her a samsung,It's fair
3,Good tablet but not as smooth as high end tablets. It's limited to Amazon so don't expect to do as much as an Android or iPad. I like mine and will continue to use it. I recommend using one if you can before buying.,Good tablet for what it's designed to do
3,It's unfair for me to rate this product cause I have not even taken it out of the box to set it up.,Haven't set it up yet

However its limited on games and its app store is c.r.a.p compared to android. So ehhh 50/50.","Its not an android, but it'll do"
3,"Good size screen and clarity for the money. Seems fairly robust. The biggest problem is putting apps on it, at least free games.

After much digging around Amazon web site I found out who would help me. I gave it a one star and Amazon helped me quick. We were able to get it going again, a manual would help. The device works again. I found the tablet to be very functional, I watch Netflix, listen to Spotify, watch YouTube videos, it works great!",Amazon Fire 8 has 90 day warranty

3,"A rating of 3 starts is what I can give this product. The Fire HD8 show a nice picture and is used mostly to watch NetFlix.

The screen doesn't always respond. The Internet freezes a lot. The colors seem to be a little off. All in all, still a decent piece for the price.","More options, more problems"
3,"The specs are good, feels solid, can't stand the OS. Too many ads you can't get rid of, not as customizable as I'd like. If that doesn't bother you, it's a good tablet for the price. Don't expect to run games on it, not powerful enough for that.",Okay Tablet
3,The Kindle Fire HD is perfect for playing simple games and for streaming video while away from home. It's thin and light.,Simple but Good
3,"Th size difference is noticeable and squarish rather then rectangular, which I prefer. The Kindle unit itself is rather nice, the auto rotate and adjust being the best part. I returned this item b/c the cover is flimsy. and I was afraid I would drop it and break the kindle.",Not for me
3,"I bought 2 and am returning them both. Both had lighting issues. On the first one, one half of the screen had a white/blue tint and the other half was more of a yellow tint. When i flipped the device upside down to rotate to use with my other hand, half of the screen went much darker than the other. I returned it because I had read there were some that had lighting issues and bought another one. My second one was worse. You could see little half moons going down one side. That one also had a much yellower tint overall than the first one.I found it not easy to hold unless it was in the charging case. It was too slippery and, weird to say, small for me. I'm a female with average sized hands.I think what I really did love was the charging case and the size for transport purposes. Maybe when they make a few tweaks and lower the price I might try again.",Wanted to love it
3,"I owned a Kindle Keyboard for about a year, and I purchased the leather lighted case for that unit. While the corner light left a little to be desired as far as even lighting, overall I was very pleased with the case. Based on that experience, I went ahead and purchased the lighted cover for my new Kindle. I can't say this experience has as been as positive.Let's start off with what's good about the case. The Kindle battery powered light is a big improvement. The light is now centered on the screen, so illumination is more even now. I don't use the light often, but in the cases where I do it will be nice to have more balanced coverage. One positive on the case itself is that I appreciate how much lighter this one feels than the previous generation. The hinge area is smaller, which means less of the spine folding effect the other one took on after heavy use. I never took my Kindle Keyboard out of the case after it was put in, so the snug fit I have seen complaints about is not an issue for me. It IS tight, though, so if you don't plan to keep the case on full time be aware it may take some effort to get it back out. In my situation, that tight fit is exactly what I want, but your mileage may vary.Now on to the negatives. The case does feel very cheap, especially with no change in price point. The previous cover felt like a solidly made piece of work, whereas the new cover only feels half as sturdy. The thinness of the case was no doubt done to minimize its weight, so I realize this is a personal issue. Outside the thickness, though, it just doesn't look or feel as well made. The textured surface of the previous model you that leather feel, very much like a real book. Finally, the most stunning oversight is the lack of a closure device.Read more",A Step Down In Quality

3,"I got this tablet for my 2 year old after her previous tablet cracked when she dropped it, and wasn't too impressed with it. I had to wait about 3 weeks for the Wifi to be setup at home, and found out it was way too reliant on the internet for most things to work. After inserting the SD card from her other tablet I was hoping it'd be easy to view videos, pictures, and music and had such a hard time figuring it out. It took a long time for the videos and pictures to show up because I wasn't connected to Wifi, and it didn't recognize any music files. Once I did connect it, it was annoying to see that ads were displayed on the Lock Screen. Overall it's a good tablet, but I just didn't like all the apps that are installed and rely on Amazon's paid services.",Good tablet for the price
3,"I purchased this tablet for my granddaughter, and she can't put it down!",Great tablet for kids!

3,"The Amazon warranty of this product is great for a reason, it needs to be because they have to keep replacing it. I had two that died within weeks and every single one has broken the screen.","eh, okay starter tablet"
3,"Great tablet for the price! I bought two of these for my Grandkids to use, as they are always using ours! The only thing that I really don't like about them is that they have so many pop in commercials for grown ups and it makes everything stop. Hard for my little three year old to get this! I wish it were a little more kid friendly as far as ease of use and getting to where you want to be. For the price, I guess we will just deal with it! :)",Great tablet for the price

3,"A decent machine for the Black Friday price of under $40. The 8 GB of memory is inadequate if you play games using the Apps. I added a 32 GB micro SD card, but not all the Apps use it and the ones that do, only transfer part of the application to it. All points, coins, etc earned are retained in internal memory, not SD card. Pictures, videos, music can be stored on SD card. Screen is very sharp.",Slightly Disappointed
3,"We purchased this for our 5 & 4 yr olds. It is something to help with learning to read and write.The big downfall is that even the ""free"" apps require you to purchase add-ons to unlock more of the app.",Great tablet for the money

3,I ordered my fire HD like a week before Christmas. The day I received it I ordered a case for it on amazon and before I even got the case it fell fro! About 2 ft off the floor on carpet and the screen cracked. I called BestBuy and I was told that I had. Free 6 months protection on it so I made an appointment with geek squad my husband called out of work to take me and when we go they tell me that I don't have any protrvtion plan and that there isn't anything they can do for me.

3,"This is the first time that I've used a Kindle tablet. I've used Android and Apple devices before, and this is a different beast. People that are used to an Android experience, will not be thrilled with this device. Even though it looks like Android, the Play Store is not available and not all of the basic apps are included in the Kindle Store. If I had to do it all over again I'd spend an extra $50 or $60 and get an actual Android tablet.",First Kindle Tablet
3,"I like the Kindle fire over all, but the Kindles definitely have issues with the charging ports. We have the older 7s and we have issues with getting the cords to charge them. As a parent, you are better off not having children plug them in. We still continue to purchase new one because of the reasonable pricing and due to all the amazon app purchases we have made through the years. Hopefully one day they will design a better charging port",Still not a fan of the charging port

3,"This Kindle is great for the price. However, there are some downsides to paying for a $50 tablet. The battery life goes very quickly, so daily charges are necessary if you're a heavy reader.

3,"I bought this expecting the same quality i have received in the previous 3 kindles I purchased. I am disappointed. I like the price. The home screen is just all the apps right in your face, not just the ones you want, like in the older version kindle fire. I mostly use it for reading books, and so far I'm dissatisfied. It's great to swipe to the next page, but when I want to go to settings or something else while reading I find it difficult to open. Instead the page just turns and by the time I finally get to the book settings, I've lost my spot! I downloaded the Facebook app and it's very slow. Maybe it's Amazons way of telling me that's what I get for $50 but come on. Sometimes I like to use the kindle to search the web and that too is slow. I compared it to my older version and there is a noticible difference in speed. I know there are other cool user tools, but for me I mostly use it to read and check Facebook and maybe Pinterest. It's priced well if you want it for kids, it's user friendly and my kids have already figured out all the options. I would recommend it for kids or for people who are technologically not savvy.",Slow

3,"My view comes from being only a IPad user. And my purchase purpose was for a very young granddaughter whose sole purpose right now is to steal my Ipad to watch YouTube cartoons, and she operates it very well.I'm giving this 3 stars because I'm returning this in less than 24 hours. So I didn't give this much of a chance. First it seems it REALLY wants you to sign up for Amazon Free Time ($4.99 month). Guessing my experience would be a whole lot smoother if I did that.So created the child profile on the tablet, moved the YouTube app to the profile. Opened the app and got selections for Popular, Music, Movies etc... Could not locate a ""search"" feature. After repeated tapping, got Music to open. Only to get a warning that ""this content is restricted in the Amazon Free Time app"". What? So I have to join to unlock YouTube? I'm technically savy so the fact that I was frustrated didn't bear well for the granddaughter. Maybe there was another way around this but I didn't look. Should not have to.Couple this with the random ads for games, Amazon Prime, etc that pops up and that was enough for me. So going back to get a Windows tablet where you click on the YouTube app you get what you are expecting without restrictions. For the $49.99 price I had to try this. But not for me.",Amazon Free Time Ad machine
3,Better quality then most tablets in same price range. I still suggests the accident protection plan or at least a okay case for it. Ads on lock screen is a bit of a let down but it functions like its supposed to.,Decent Quality

3,"I would say this is great for kids, but the apps are very limited. There are only a few good free apps in the kindle store. The battery life is very poor. The volume is either loud or it can't be heard. It's hard to find a good middle ground. Overall it's still a good tablet for the price.",Sturdy & durable

3,"Purchased this to mainly read books after my Nook died. Can't beat the price, but the print quality isn't as good as some other tablets. It's more like black on grey as oppose to crisp white. It can be a little difficult to read from versus the higher price tablets.",Nice basic tablet for the low price
3,The only thing that I didn't like was that I had to sign up with Amazon Prime in order for my son to get unlimited games. I ended up paying a little bit more.,Great tablet for the price
3,"I bought a first generation Kindle Fire a few years back, when it was on sale for something like 185.00 and loved it. It took a bit of a beating and I had recently begun to think about buying a replacement. I think that original tablet would probably be more comparable to the Fire HD 10 or something. So my experience with this version is colored by the higher quality first generation model. I also use a Surface Pro tablet as my personal/work computer, so that too probably color my opinion. Out of the box this is lighter than the original. Upon powering up, the original bookshelf carousel is now replaced by a more standard tablet home screen. In terms of processing speed this version feels a little slow. Games I had on the original seem to struggle a bit on the new Fire. Web-browsing is not terrible but is not terribly fast either. In the end, if you want a good e-reader on a budget with a few extra features, this is a great buy.

3,Initially I bought this for my son and he's been using it everyday with a protective cover since my purchase my only issue I have really with the unit is that the charging port is in a horrible position and it's very difficult to insert the charger easily I may have a defective unit which I may have to return since the charging port is quite loose the price was right but quality could be a little better,Overall good value but needs improvement
3,Not bad for an entry-level tablet. Pretty much what I expected for the price I paid for it. My four-year-old loves it,Well worth the price

3,"So I love my electronics. I have an Ipad but when I saw this on sale I got myself one just to have since I am a prime member I figured I could use this too. The only thing I like about this is that you an expand the the storage. If the Ipad had that option it would be amazing. So since I then expanded the memory I can have more movies to watch offline. Camera is horrible, So I would say if you have a younger child, this may be decent but nothing compares to an ipad.",JUST OK
3,"You get what you pay for. A small tablet, with OK specs. What was annoying about this tablet was the fact that you have to pay to remove ""offers."" You shouldn't have to pay to remove bloatware.",Too small

3,"it's just ok for a tablet, it doesn't have google play store of course which limits a wide variety. I would think by now they would offer most of the play store apps but nope.

3,Tablet works wells for easy reading. It is also very lightweight.,Good for the price

3,This movie could have been a little more action packed. Ok for what it was,Was an ok movie
3,"Screen, camera, and processor don't perform too well but for the price you pay, it's definitely a bargain.",Great tablet for the price!
3,Good starter tablet. Best used as a book reader. Not really for business use,Good starter tablet
3,PPI too low for reading.. kinda regret getting it.. should've gotten a used ipad instead.,OK tablet
3,I love that my son loves to read and all so the Kindle is perfect for him. It updates and is very easy to use. I don't like that it's as fragile as it is. My 12 year old has plenty of electronics but the screen has already cracked on this one. I'm not too happy about that.,Great but fragile
3,Good tablet for reading books you love... still need to get used to it since all I have used in the past are apple products .,Good product

3,"Smaller than I thought and processing speed is not very good. With that said, for the price you can't beat it...",Can't beat the price but...

3,Good as a reader. Decent tablet for price. After a few months battery drains quickly.,Great for kindle app
3,The free Geek Squad virus protection does not work and the apps you can download are limited.,"I like the actual product however,"
3,"I'm ambivalent about this tablet. It's a great price point and the picture quality is amazing. It's great for watching Netflix. But, you are locked in to only the apps available on Amazon. I can't download my browser if choice or even the google search app. Additionally, the tablet is linked to Amazon, and basically unusable if you don't have a valid Amazon account, I bought an additional tablet for a non Amazon person and they couldn't download any apps.",OK beginner tablet
3,Got this for my daughter & grandson for their birthday.,Great birthday present
3,Over all the product is good and works as advertised but lately it is constantly having issues keeping enet connection and even worse has issues updating. We were told this is a larger amazon network issue.,Good for the sale price
3,"If you just want to watch movies or shop, it does the job. Not enough memory to do much else. But for the price its great for kids.",plain and simple
3,This is good for beginners but not very good . Its wifi work terrible,Its okay
3,"I own 3 of these kindles, for my children who are young. They can take some wear and tear, but recently one of mine quit charging. The charger will no longer connect with the port inside the kindle. The kindle itself was working just fine, but since it can no longer be charged, it is no longer functioning. I am really disappointed, and plan on buying a replacement. My children love being able to play on the kindle and for the price you really can't beat the deal.",Decent tablet for the price
3,"Seems like a good value, though I'm not sure how much it allows Amazon to spy on me. Major problem, does not connect my WIFI at home. My Android and Lap Top connect; and the Fire connects elsewhere, not sure if it's a WIFI problem or a Fire problem. Will contact Amazon to see if they can tell. Otherwise I would recommend.",Almost a very good cheap smaller tablet
3,"Was a bit difficult to initially set up. Ease in operations would be great, the tablet doesn't hold battery well at all. It seems that maybe and hour or two goes by before time to re-up on battery life.",Okay
3,"This is not as cheap feeling as I thought it was going to be. It's definitely not in the iPad class but it's not bad for what it is. I ordered online and did not have one in my hands until mine arrived. Pros: The screen is decent, sound is loud enough for me, no lag scrolling and Real Racing 3 plays smoothly. Cons: The major down side is battery charging time, battery life and built in storage space. When it arrived, it was showing 76% remaining. After less than 2.5 hours use, it had to be charged. I just read where it can take 6 hours or longer to charge. My iPad Air 2 can fully charge in a few hours from 0%. Built in storage is not enough. Yes you can get micro SD cards however some apps will only install on the built in storage. Also, you can not delete Amazon apps without voiding the warranty. And unless I'm missing something, you can't move them either.So if you are looking for something to use casually for web surfing, email, watching movies, reading books and the occasional game, this should be just fine...keeping in mind the battery life and lack of built in storage. But you won't be doing any serious work on this like you can on the iPad's. But to be fair, this is 1/10 the price of my iPad Air 2 and 1/8 the cost of an iPad Mini 4. But I don't believe it's meant to be a direct iPad competitor. Because if it were, it would fail miserably.",Good for what it is

3,"Bought this for 4 year old to watch Netflix and movies via Google Play.The entire user experience is Amazon-centric. The OS appears to be Android-based but is repackaged/rebuilt as FireOS. As a result this device does NOT have an Android OS user-interface.I was able to install the NetFlix app but I did not test it. You cannot load the Google Play app, which means that all the kid's movies (i.e. Toy Story, etc) that we intended to play are not available.

3,"Each time that the Kindle Fire needs to be unlocked, an advertisement pops up on the screen. To remove these ads cost an additional fee, so be aware that this is the case. I have owned Nooks previously and they were more flexible in usage - such as being able to read epub books easily, for example.","Works ok, but the ads are annoying"

3,I bought this tablet for my child because he previously had one. Not much storage and the cord strips easily.,Ok tablet
3,ok product serves the purpose nothing more than that,ok product
3,"The product is good for children. The downside is, the tablet's charging port will get loose and not function anymore within the first month of use. If you plan on giving this to a child, make sure you take care of charging it for them, dont let them do it on their own, or they will most likely mess up the port even quicker as they are a bit careless.",Messes up quickly
3,Silk is painfully slow and doesn't work on many websites. Had to install Mozilla to use bestbuy.com ironically. I can't put in orders with Silk (the default Fire browser). If using Silk make sure to disable the caching to Amazons servers. With caching on the browser is almost unusable.Ads are really annoying (only come on when you first turn it on) but I don't even really notice what they are. Usually things I'd never purchase like makeup (I'm a guy) or other junk. These make decent devices for the kids for playing games on too. This is not a quality device like a Galaxy Tab but for the price its good enough because you know they're going to break it at some point.,good for the money but Silk is terrible

3,"For $50 this is a fine tablet, However I bought a 64gb SD card to expand the storage, however i have found that a majority of apps are not able to be saved to the external card , nor can they save data to it (for example Netflix).

3,I have bought multiple fire tablets and will continue too. I would advise to get the protection plan for any problems and we have had a few. The tablets work good for the most part but I would upgrade the memory to 16 if you are going to play a lot of games.,Nice price
3,"Decent screen, kinda slow response on the touch screen.",Slow response
3,"I'd say for the price it was a decent Tablet it did what I needed it to do but the support I'd say through the App side was a bit rather weak which is the big downfall of this tablet. Amazon also does a lot of advertisements on the tablet for example the lock screen and multiple pages on your home screens which can be rather annoying and unremoveable. Otherwise I used it to watch videos, surf the web and use a few social media apps. Good for kids too both videos and games side. So I'd say in general for the price it's a decent tablet, but if you are looking to do more and have a smoother tablet you might want to pay more for something better.",Good Tablet for Basic Use and Kids

3,"I decided I wanted to ""try"" a tablet for reading books and a little social media instead of using my phone all the time. I researched the Fire 7 and Fire HD 8 and settled on the 7 knowing that it is a low end device. The device is slick and easy to use, and the Alexa integration is really cool. But ""It's a $50 tablet"". At times, the performance is awful slow. I suspect it is updating content, say on twitter or FB. My complaint is when it is doing this, there are no visuals to let you know it is busy. I finally got on Amazon's chat feature, and several hours later, including several power cycles and a complete factory restore, the performance is the same. The reps at Amazon tried their best - and FWIW, I knew there was nothing they could do to speed it up before I contacted them, but I thought I would give it a try. So get this if you want, just be patient. Remember, ""It's a $50 tablet"". If you want better performance, spend more $$.",It's a $50 tablet

3,Average tablet for general use. I still like Apple better!,Average tablet
3,Worth the money when on sale-slow connection compared to a laptop,Got on sale
3,"Works good for my grandkids to play with when they are visiting me at my home.. I really needed to buy 3 instead of 2. Only gripe I have is the seemingly ""forced"" ads popping up, which appear to be built into it. Maybe I will learn someday how to stop them. :(",Amazon Fire 7
3,This tablet offers the user more options than a regular tablet but the ease of use a beginner would love,Great for ppl new to technology
3,"It's ok, it's good for beginner users, the kids love it because they could play games on it",Amazon Fire 7
3,"Very little storage, Amazon Android skin bloated and too many ads",OK starter tablet
3,"I didnt realize, even though I should have, that I could not add whatever programs I wanted to for it. I wanted to get this so I could play games on the tablet while home, instead of my phone. I was able to install one of the two games I play, but was unable to with the second. I will actually be returning it because that means I have no use for it. My wife has one and hers has been great for her this entire time.",Not for me
3,"Bought this an an auxiliary pad instead of a second iPad, which I have had for years. So, far, other than reading books on it I haven't been able to accomplish much. Most of the apps I use on my iPad don't have a compatible version. But, it was cheap, so even as just an e-reader I decided to keep it.",Not Worth the Price
3,Got this for my kids for Christmas. Price was nice and no problems so far.,Nice Tablet for Kids
3,"The unit itself is very simple to use, somewhat difficult to get connected at startup but once setup ran flawlessly. Memory a little small.",Nice unit for the beginner
3,"Durable and small, makes it easy for taking any where. Price isn't bad either.",Good price
3,Love the tablet! Got it for my niece and nephew! Great for beginners!!,Great tablet for young ones
3,"Since this is an Android 5 based tablet, I sideloaded a few necessary apps to allow it to be used essentially the same as an Android tablet, with Google play store, etc. The screen resolution, speaker, RAM are just only adequate. Otherwise, a good cheap tablet. Really need to ponder its utility before buying it.","OK tablet, with necessary tinkering"
3,"The product would be great if it was easier to find the setting icon and if amazon wouldn't charge you a $1 for downloading applications that are labeled ""free."" The one dollar is automatically charged by amazon but you can dispute it with your Credit Company.",Simple and easy to use
3,Just wish I could remove most of the Amazon apps other then that it's good for the kids.,Good cheap tablet
3,I bought this tablet for my 4 year old it's a good tablet for the 33 dollars I paid. I just wish I could remove some of the Amazon apps.,Good cheap tablet
3,Bought for $40 for my toddler. Mostly used for Netflix and a few kid games.,Good cheap tablet for kids
3,"Bought this device to stream Netflix, Amazon Prime, and to play downloaded content. For that purpose it is sufficient. I wouldn't use a Fire Tablet as a productivity device as it is seriously underpowered. Fire tablet bogged down pretty quickly when I attempted to multi-task. Bottomline, this is not an iPad replacement - particularly if you like to do a variety of things on your tablet. But at $33 on sale, this was a very good deal for my purposes.",Sufficient for streaming.
3,I like this tablet because it entertains my kid and he loves it,nice tablet for a kid
3,"I like the reader, nice and small. What i don't like is if you have a very secure wifi system at home, it does not let you set it up. I had to go to my daughters house and set it up. That is a bit alarming. It should be more secure since the only way we can put items on there is by putting our information on it that can be compromised. Make it more secure and easy to put protection on it. That is the only reason I didn't make it a 5 star product.",Reader
3,It's a decent quality tablet for the money. One complaint is the speakers are weak. Have to cup my hand around the speaker side to get some good feedback. The Silk Browser seems to have issues with search engines. Just switching the search engine fixes it though.I got this for when the power goes out at my house. It's served to let me watch netflix. With a bluetooth keyboard it seems adequate for messaging and writing out notes.Video quality is good enough. Though that has more to do with not being super picky about it. I'm considering gifting my dad one of these this year. He commented that the quality looked good. Another complaint would be the amazon app store is limited. No Clash Royale. Which is the only mobile game I actually enjoy. I'm sure there's a way around this. But I'm really not interested in digging around for it. So for the most part it's a good solid low end tablet.,Decent Quality for the money
3,"Bought for my kids and very easy to use, and made homework easier",Easy to use
3,Great product. I bought it because I travel alot now,Great
3,Decent product that has great value. Definitely buy again for a gift,Decent product
3,"I bought this tablet for my son. He used it for mainly games. I though he would like reading his books on it but he prefers the actual book vs digital books. It works great, fast, and vibrant colors. I play with it on occasion. It fits in my hand at night and it's larger than my phone but not as expensive as other tablets. All in all it was worth the money.",Great buy for younger adults
3,My kids get kind of lost when they use this product. It does have everything but is not as user-friendly as I hoped it would be.,It has everything but not as easy to use
3,Nice kids tablet for a decent price. I bought it for a road trip.,Nice kids tablet

3,"My mom bought this for my sister, she loved it. Great gift!",Mom Bought As A Present
3,"Decent performance but sometime do lag a bit, screen resolution is a bit low for someone coming from a Galaxy S6 and Note 7. But for $33 (got on a sale) you can't expect top end product.

3,it has a good picture low price. used for vacation condo.,good for the price
3,"Decent tabletPerforms ok You really get what you pay forDo not expect anything special with this tablet. It works. Does what its meant to do and nothing more. Having a Prime subscription is a must but not a requirement to take full advantage of this tablet. Its pretty much an Amazon Portal for all the services they offer. Great for my son streaming his shows like Sesame Street, PBS, etc Netflix works fine as well",Decent
3,"Everyone knows ""kindle fire"". When these went on sale I grabbed a few up to use as kiosks for our PTA. Little did I know that fires run a ""special"" operating system, not a standard android. The 2 apps I needed to run were not available on kindle store. After much research I found a work around but it was very frustrating.",Kindle Fire
3,"Because the Amazon Fire 7 is a very inexpensive tablet, you cant really expect much out of it or compare it to an iPad. It is a great budget tablet for very light gaming and watching videos. My primary use for it is for video consumption.",Great for the Price
3,"I was a bit disappointed by the lack of the Android play store, navigation on it is a pain.",It's good for the price
3,"This tablet is useful if you have prime and invest in the Amazon ecosystem. I prefer my other Android tablets more, but for the price I paid for this one it was a great deal.",It's okay
3,Great price.... It's good for games play and great tablet with this price,Nice tablet
3,great for toddlers. I recommend anyone to purchase a protective case,Great tablet for toddlers
3,"We bought this for our 8 yr old daughter and it's great for most of what she does, but it is not good for playing a lot of games because it locks up sometimes or it runs a little slower. So if we had to do it again we'd probably buy something with a bigger processor.",Amazon Fire 8 Gb
3,I bought this as a gift for a less technically inclined person as a gateway into learning tablets and apps. It was a good gift.,Good deal for the price
3,"I bought the Amazon Fire to have easily portable access to my email and the Internet while traveling. It is a good basic tablet. Some of the text is somewhat hard to read as of is quite small. I don't have a stylus which would make use much easier. Overall, it is a good value for my limited need's and use.",Basic tablet
3,"My elderly uncle is pleased to have his device. He's still not real sure about how to use it, but happy he has one.",Good enough for my elderly uncle.
3,This is a cheap tablet. I bought this so that my kids wouldn't ruin another IPad by crushing it. This tablet can stop working out of nowhere shut off and never turn on again. If it doesn't have a case and you drop it kiss this good bye because even a light drop can destroy it.,An ok tablet.
3,"I bought it as a replacement for a broken tablet. There are several apps I'd like to add to it that are not available, and it won't update the Facebook app so I wind up using my phone for many things that I used to do on my tablet. If it wasn't a good e reader, it would be worthless, but I do read on it a lot, so I'm keeping it but I would still like a new tablet - which is disappointing.","Great e-reader, not so great as a tablet"
3,I like the tablet. Great price. But the charging cord is to short and there isn't an indicator light to inform you when the tablet is charging.,Like but missing a few things.
3,This tablet freezes a lot when using it. It started out working good and then it started freezing when playing games.,Freezes a lot when using it.
3,I bought this hoping that I could use it for a book reader and other lightweight tasks. The wifi is very slow and the tablet in general is slow and hangs to much,Just ok
3,I got it because I wanted to be able to use it to download books for college classes. It is slow and seems to freeze up a bit when I try to use it. I have a 64g memory card in it and have most of my stuff saved to it. I wouldn't think that would cause it to run slow.,It's okay
3,"Ok, so, I wanted an e-reader and had thought about just buying an iPad mini. I wish I had. Don't get me wrong, this tablet does the job it's meant to do but that's about it. If you're looking for a tablet that you can play games on, browse through Facebook or instagram on, or even surf the net then you're better off getting an upgraded version of this tablet or an iPad as I said before. Plus, this tablet comes packed with apps that are unnecessary and just plain memory wasteful. However, if you just need it to read your books or magazines then this is the perfect little companion for you. I'm saving for an iPad.",Not Bad For A 'Tablet'

3,Look was good and very comfortable for reading. If allowed to install android store that would be really awesome.,Nice tablet for the price
3,"I really like the features, the size, and the price, but I was a bit disappointed with the lack of speed!","Great tablet, but a little slow"
3,"Bought for very young grandkids. You get what you pay for. A little slow. Good for watching things like Netflix and playing games and JWBroadcasting. Navigation okay. Not great. Kids are usually hard on anything, so if it gets broken, ok. But no problems so far and the kids like it. Would never buy for myself, or anyone over 10.",Nice economical buy for very young kids (under 10)
3,Good for the price. Low memory but good descent graphics easy to use,Impulse buy
3,"If you're just going to read and play a game or two, maybe surf the internet a bit, this is an ok tablet. But if you are a heavy user, I'd tell you to pass on this tablet because it won't keep up with your surfing/games/e-mail.",Ok tablet
3,"This is an ok tablet. We bought it thinking it would be good for travels with our little one, but it's not what we expected. Our little one is able to exit out of movies and apps. There is no way to lock the app when it is in use with little ones. This would be a good tablet for a teenager or adult who wants a tablet but doesn't want to spend a lot of money.",Ok Tablet
3,This product is fast a stylish. Good battery life. Helps to be a regular Amazon client.,Great for regular Amazon users
3,I'm still learning how to use it. I like that it is small enough to put in my purse.,Still learning how to use it
3,I love reading books on here. Playing games are also nice for the kids with the free time kid app. Only thing I don't like is the sound is not very loud. If the sound was louder it would get a 5 star rating.,Great tablet for books plus more!!
3,gave to daughter and son. they are enjoying them very much,gifts
3,You get what you pay for. It's $50 and that's about the quality you get. Overall works great but slow and crashes occasionally. Not the best battery.,Cheap tablet

3,Ok device for the asking price. Would give as first time user,Ok device
3,Compared to the initial kindle this is a big impovement. Great for the Black friday promotional price.,Kindle Fire
3,Works fine for what I wanted it for. Using as a remote for my home automation and entertainment system,Not bad
3,I have not personslly used this item but it was a requested gift for family member so they obviously were aware of benefits. No complaints so far so guess it's good,A gift
3,"I have the Kindle Fire HD, so when i bought this i expected something up to that caliber or better. Sadly, it did not. In my opinion the older one is better in sound quality. The new one is lighter, but I did pay less for it.",Not as great as I expected.
3,"You get what you pay for, or so they say. We purchased 3 and 1 of the tablets has started to fail. Mind you my daughter has used it for a week. We have had to reboot it 2 times now. Of course we googled the issue and were able to fix the problem ourselves. It goes completely black. Other 2 tablets are perfectly fine so far.",Price resonable
3,"Got the nieces, wife, and myself these for Christmas. Figures they were cheap enough, so why not.These are functional tablets in every way. We haven't found any problem with them. The display isn't a hi resolution, so I wasn't expecting great. I've had phones and tablet with the same resolution, but never one that looked quite as lack luster as this display. They are OK for the kids to beat around with because they broke the last tablet they had. This one probably wont last much longer, but it's cheap. I wish I would have spent a few more bucks and gotten better ones for my wife and I, though.If you want a disposable tablet or color reader for magazines and such, you'll probably be OK with this.If you want a good tablet, think about buying a good tablet.",Good cheap tablet with less than stunning display
3,If you want an inexpensive device to read Kindle books or do email this is it.,Adequate for its purpose
3,I would say that it is not for kids is because my kids have been downloading game after game even with a 64 gig sd card the main operating system only allows about 2 gigs of games that cannot be transferred to the data card so storage is very limited,"OK for adults, but not for kids"
3,"Camera has poor resolution, charging time is slow.","Good screen for reading, acceptable price-quality"
3,I have other Kindles and this one is okay. For the price it was a decent buy. I may go to a larger size the next time as this seems small.,small tablet
3,Its ok for price point but it is heavily advertised to manipulate you to purchase more from amazon.,Its ok for money. But it is heavily advertised
3,A bit confusing compared to the older style. I am not a big fan of this version. I wish we could take off things that we are not using like we could with the older version. Great for the price.It has an awesome parental control though.,meh
3,"I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend's 8yr old daughter. She absolutely loves it, and it was easy to set up and use.",Great tablet for an 8 yr old.
3,The battery on this device cannot handle true apps outside of the Amazon ecosystem. Youtube and Twitch would drain the battery in under an hour. But if used as intended it would be great for books and email.,Google Play sideloads easy but.....
3,"Gets the job done as a tablet I guess, apps are limited but this isn't meant to be a full on tablet, its a reader. It does freeze ad glitch a little but for the price I guess its worth it.",Okay Cheap Tablet.

3,"Bought i, was OK but don't use it anymore for the price it is good though",Simple tablet
3,They are ok for a kid to play games on. But I don't like it for myself. I will just save for an iPad.,Okay enough for game playing
3,"I bought one of these on Black Friday on impulse since it was $34.99 and I had a $5 certificate to use. I have a third generation iPad and am quite accustomed to using it and the App Store.Pros: OS is Android based and not too hard to pick up compared to Apple. I did find versions of a lot of favorite apps and games to download. It can take up to 128GB microSD card for expanding storage (only 8 GB built in). I got a 64 GB class 10 card at Costco for $20.Cons: screen resolution is only 1024 x 768, but I can't say it's super noticeable in normal use. Not all apps available even if an Android version exists. Much more useful if you have Amazon Prime as it ties directly to an Amazon.com account, and In fact you have to register the device before you can do much of anything on it. Battery life is not impressive either, with standby time in particular not great.For the price, it's a handy spare internet connected device. I'm not one to buy Kindle books, but the ones I do have are certainly easy to access and read.","It's no iPad, but useful"
3,"The tablet is nice but the internet source takes forever to load so it is just easier to use a standard computer or phone to surf the web or get on Facebook, etc.",Good but slow
3,"I had to spend a lot of time figuring out how to allow apps from the Google Play store to be installed. Without that capability this tablet isn't very good. Amazon just doesn't have enough apps available. I did a fare amount of research on the internet to find the process for installing the google play store. I also notice that this isn't a ""snappy"" and ""fast"" device but I wouldn't expect it to be for $50. For the right situation this is a great buy.",Great for the price; some issues
3,Nice tablet for kids. A little slow loading. The fire time is extremely hard for children to operate. I guess it's ok for kids and beginners. I haven't decided if we are going to keep it or return it.,Slow loading...

3,It's a basic tab. Only for reading. I didn't keep it.,limited
3,"My girls were super excited to get their Fires for Christmas! Unfortunately, one of them stopped recognizing the touch screen after an hour of opening.

3,"I got this for my 88 year old mother to view pics on Facebook of her children,grandchildren,great grandchildren and great great grandchildren.

3,"I bought two of these for my kids, They've destroyed ipads and this was a low cost replacement. Great price still not an ipad substitute",Great Gift for Kids not teens
3,"I bought this to enjoy the comforts of a tablet. My use includes youtube, twitch and other channels that are similar in purpose. I would recommend this product for its own intended purposes which is a ereader at best. it does have its own android base functions but not the functions I enjoy from a regular tablet.

3,Easy to download apps and nice to watch movies and my daughter loves it,the most sensible tablet
3,The fire is a good product for its price. We bought it for travel and it worked like we wanted it to. The volume was lacking though. Trying to listen to a movie an the plane was very difficult.,Great value
3,It is an ok product. But the main reason for the purchase was because it was for a first time tablet owner. It is very cheap in price but without a google play store it kind of sucks. But like it says it is ok for the price.,"Amazon Fire 7"""

3,"Great tablet for kids, however DO NOT charge this tablet in your car! The charger in your car will ruin your tablet! The Fire 7 tablet charger can only handle so much current and your car charger has too much current! We could not power on the tablet after trying to charge our tablets using the car charger.

3,I dont like the kindle because u cant connect it chromecast!,Dont buy
3,"We 2 Amazon Fire's for our kids for Christmas. We chose these because product reviews were good and the price was decent compared to other electronic pads. Since having them, they have been decent, but not great. The kids will turn them on to play games and their home screens don't always appear; sometimes when they want to play a game that is already downloaded, the pad acts like it needs to re-download the game; and there is a lot of frustration when all of the downloads start circling and they cannot do anything with their pads. Turning the pads completely off does not always help and sometimes, we cannot even get them to turn off. When they do work properly though, the kids love them. They are decent for a 1st time pad for kids for not a lot of money, but just keep in mind they can be frustrating at times.",Decent Amazon Fire
3,I use this mini tablet at the gym to watch streaming tv and movie shows.- easy to setup- take a bit of time to get used to various screens- touch screen is a little slow to respond- bluetooth connectivity is not automatic.

3,"I ended up returning this tablet. For the price, $40, the tablet performed very well. However, if you have the money, do yourself a favor and step out of the Amazon lineup. The iPads are great, in my opinion the best, but they cost $$$$. From what I've experienced, the Samsung Tab A line is a solid tablet for a $$ budget. You can often find one on sale for ~$150 and its a pretty good bang-for-the buck.If the money is your ONLY concern, then this will probably work well enough for you.",Good tablet for $ budget

3,"Bought this as a cheaper alternative for using with kids. Battery lasts longer than most tablets, the reason why I gave this such a mediocre rating is because you can't put a wallpaper for the lock screen. You always have an ad for something Amazon related, which can be annoying. But if it's just something small for the kiddos to use, good choice. I wouldn't recommend for adults.",Slow but gets the job done
3,"I got this tablet for my 20 month old son. He constantly wants my phone or iPad to watch YouTube kids videos. He can work both of these apple devices all on his own. I figured he was ready for his own tablet, hoping he'd leave mine alone. No luck. The Fire is not as user-friendly as my iPhone. Even on the child setting it is not easy to use. The surface is not as responsive to touch. He gets frustrated with it and puts it down after a few minutes of trying. Now his daddy uses it and he still goes after my iPad and phone. If you want a tablet for your toddler, just get an iPad.",It's no iPad
3,"I thought I would get the fire as a back up tab for my grand daughters. Well, in my opinion it's a little more confusing to navigate around than just a plain android tablet. So if, like me you are an android lurana566, this is a bit different to operate.",It's OK...it's no android
3,It is a lot more then I was after. I can watch my Netfix and do more,Happy
3,"I purchased Amazon Fire for my son after reading enough reviews about this product. It works ok for e-books but very slow for Internet streaming and downloading. Also, the touch function is not very sensitive which you need to hit the same button couples of time to make it work.",Very slow for Internet
3,It's ok. It does not have all the apps you might be looking for.,Ok
3,"Purchased and installed item onto Kindle but am still trying to figure out how storage onto new SD card works. I know it is me, but I think I will have to return to store to get someone to show me how to operate.","SD card for Kindle 7"""
3,"Good for watching movies offline but not so good at internet. I also have problems with it deciding I don't have the SD card in and have to take it out and put it back in. Very frustrating!!! The first one I had didn't know the SD card was there after shutting it off. They were great about sending me a new one but now I have to call them back and tell them what is going on now. I prefer to use my old Android tablet. It also won't let me remove the password or I have to take off the free time. I have to call them and see what I can do about that. It is for her and not really for me anyway. Why do I have to have a password for everything? Not too impressed but a really good buy. The ads, when you turn it on, don't bother me at all and was worth saving the $20.",Good for kids for movies
3,It allows me to have many apps and still take a good amount of pictures without running out of storage .,Nice gadget
3,"It's a decent tablet, but keep the following in mind:- if you get this for your kids to share your amazon prime account for video and game apps, you have to lock it to prevent accidental purchases. Problem is that this prevents free app and video purchases, and you have to okay every thing they do. - if you allow them access to apps and video, then that can purchase anything without limits.On top of this, they lock out the google app store and refuse to even allow access to google drive. While you can hack it to add these basic features, you will need a modicum of technical knowledge to do so.So, it's useful, but a pain too. Your needs may vary.","Decent tablet, with stupid limits due to amazon..."
3,This tablet is okay for moderate use. Mine tends to lag while playing games or surfing the internet..,It's okay
3,Its good for the price. Amazon store is not as huge as Android play store,Good for the price
3,At first I thought is was going to be great because of all the apps it had. Late I discover that all of those great apps I felt in love with needed to be purchased and pay a membership. Even though it was good for a first time tablet.,Is good for a first tablet
3,This tablet is ok for a kid. I was expecting more because it's a Fire brand.,Was expecting more
3,"Purchased this & turned around & within minutes of the purchase & before even leaving the store, found out that it would not do what my granddaughter needed. Unfortunately the clerk in electronics had told us it would & found out at the register by that person after she rang it up, that it would not. Need a little more education, I think...",Can't give a summary
3,Good buy for the price. Easy to surf the web a lot of apps in the App Store,Easy to use
3,"The tablet is okay, I mean it does the job. However, the wifi is really spotty. We even changed the wifi password (based on a YouTube video) to ensure that it works..but it keeps going in and out",Good tablet Bad wifi
3,"My gift to my grandchildren they are on it 24/7 would recommend this, prices have gone down since I first bought my oldest granddaughter hers",Kids are having fun
3,For the price the tablet works well. The biggest issue I've had is the battery life length. The battery seems to not last as long as my previous iPad mini.,Decent tablet for the price
3,I have tried to get it work& still can't get it to work!!,I can't get it work!!
3,Ok for a kid tablet the size is good you can okly use there apps,Good for kids
3,I can't use until I can get the webroot installed...I tried a geek but they wanted $40 to do it...I only paid that much for the tablet. Print is so small I can barely read it...there is probably an adjustment to font size but I don't want to get online without the webroot protection.,Would love to try using: can't get webroot install
3,"Bought this to lay on the coffee table for quick email checks and google searches. If you are looking for something to watch movies on or simple tasks, then it will do ok. Not a daily driver for sure.",Great for Kids
3,"Thos works great for surfing the web and playing games, lite and compact",Good for beginners
3,The Amazon Fire is an okay product with a decent OS and a great price. Reccommend it for kids or the elderly.,Great to pass time.
3,would have been nice to have instructions included,"fine, bought to read books"
3,"I have owned a few tablets and currently own an iPad and iPhone. I'm invested in the Amazon ecosystem via Kindle e-readers and Fire TV's. This tablet is incredibly affordable and offers acceptable performance but it's heavily restricted if you do not figure out how to install the Google Play store as the Amazon App Store is missing a huge number of ""every day apps"". It's a great extension for Fire TV's and it's certainly a good choice as a primary tablet for kids or parents who don't have an Apple budget. Personally I still find myself reaching for the iPad.",Great little tablet for the avg user BUT no iPad
3,"Kindle Fire is a decent tablet. The only turn off is the way Amazon has massacred the Android OS and makes it incompatible with chromecast most of the time. It's a great tablet for reading and saving media on the go. Other than the OS, Kindle Fire is a decent buy.",Kindle Fire 8GB
3,This is a basic tab. I bought this for my sister. You can't really do anything much on this unless you have an amazon account and you have to buy a prime membership which is expensive. But I was still able to use it for games and internet browsing. I had difficulty using it for anything more. Camera was not the best.,Really Basic
3,"Purchased Blue unit - parenthesis below is error correction for that review since BB does not allow edit. Good bare bones tablet for anyone if that is all you seek. Do not expect the performance of a $400 tablet for $50. I have wifi & bluetooth going while streaming netflix and it performs fine, no lag on a reliable network. This is an amazon based OS, not a traditional android system.... so it is all geared toward amazon advertising/purchasing and will not let you do much unless you register your device with an amazon account, (*which is linked to and displays any saved credit card/payment data associated with your account. Not very private or secure in my opinion.*) All apps must be obtained from their amazon app store, no google play store which is considerably simpler. There are ways around this of course if you know how. One more thing that is important and it is this... After more than a week, I finally noticed with more use that my screen has 2 spots with dead pixels which show up as solid white dots and cannot be seen unless on a very dark or black screen. After searching & reading online, it seems there are very many reports of these tablets purchased from any source having this issue. Even read someone who purchased a 5 pack and had several units with dead pixels. Test your new tablet right away after buying on a dark screen. You may be fine but it pays to look. I did not overly use my tablet at first and did not notice right away and though I still have the receipt, I already discarded the packaging. I am at the 14 day point today and could have still returned it otherwise, but honestly for all I use it for I am not overly concerned. Still whether 50 or 400 dollars, a brand new item should be free of defects. Again, so far I find it to be a reliable device if a simple bare bones tablet is all you need.",Good for Basic use

3,Great affordable device but does not have allow for android market app downloads and is basically good for simple browsing and games.,Not bad for simple browsing and gaming function
3,"I love it for reading but, it has issues when searching the Internet at times.",Better for younger kids
3,"Works well enough but is outstanding for the price, just be wary of the operating system you could poetically download an android emulator that would make this a 4/5 instantly",Serviceable
3,"The number one aspect of this tablet is the fact that Amazon will stand behind it - for a short while. I am on my 3rd, all of which have been plagued with screen issues. Dead pixels. Everywhere. If you don't have them straight out of the box, great..but, they can develop - and in the great majority of these, they will develop. It is a known issue, and Amazon will (at least for now) replace the tablet at no charge to you. As of now, they have a 'zero dead pixel tolerance policy.' That will likely change (if it hasn't already). As far as operational ability of the tablet, it runs smoothly, and allows for up to a 32gb micro sd card - which I highly recommend, as they are absolutely boiling over with bloatware (if you buy an 8 gig, you'll have about 3.5 available to you). It is a decent tablet for browsing the internet, using as an e-reader (however, the screen isn't as bright as other e-readers), or mp3 player. As they say, you get what you pay for. This is a decent basic option.","Basic tablet, plagued with build quality issues"
3,Perfect for light surfing and reading. Don't expect much for this price range.,Great for reading
3,Has every feature a android phone would have. I mainly got it for Ebooks and it works great for that. However if your coming from a iOS device I don't suggest switching to this.,Nice
3,"It's a good tablet, mainly because I order so much off amazon",Slow tablet but it costs very little
3,I got this tablet for my son works good enough for his age. I recommend this tab for kids,got it for my son
3,"this item was on a hefty sale, bought two for work purposes. a bit slow and annoyed by the constant Amazon notifications / integrations but it will work for the purpose of check emails and viewing photos.",You Get What You Pay For
3,"Was surprised by reviews I read stating this device had a great display. By no means is the display bad, but please, this device only cost $40. It does not compete with the iPad and Galaxy tablets. The Fire OS needs some sharpening up.",Experience = Price
3,first tBlet that i got was defective and returened and got anothers one because when i powered on screen was totally white,ok tablet
3,Hate Amazon! The app store doesn't have cool apps!,Hate Amazon
3,"The system is a little slow and then if you get the one with the offers, they slow down your reading a bit. But, you can't beat the price. This is not a full tablet. It' an E-Reader with a lot of enhanced functions.",Solid for the price
3,"The first one I bought had a battery failure. It wouldn't charge. Best Buy graciously supported me with a replacement. I like the tablet. Two enhancements that would be nice on it are 1) Speech to text capability and 2) Google Playstore preloaded.If you're using it for reading and internet browsing it is very good.Also, Alex (She) gave me great customer support. Kudos Alex!",The color quality is good for a small tablet
3,"After purchasing 4 Amazon Fire tablets i immediately noticed the amount of advertisement they came with at the pricing of the tablet that I bought. There's always some kind of advertisement on the screen when it wakes up. My other issue is after adding a card to make a few purchases for some apps for my kids. I removed the ability to make purchases without a password, well that did not actually happen. For a few days my children were able to make purchases in apps without any props that said; are you sure or asking for a password. I've had to completely remove the accounts and reinstall a different account for them to be able to stop making purchases. I also had them transfer the purchases to the new email a big hassle. Overall the tablet works good great for the kids.",Advertising monster
3,"Nice built tablet. You need to note that it has Amazon Store, and no Google Play Store.",Nice Tablet - No Google Play
3,"iPad without the bells and whistles. The parental controls are good, but a bit confusing. Haven't had the time to sit down and sort it out","Certainly not an iPad, but good price"
3,I was excited to get this because of the price. After taking it home I started noticing things that bothered me. I use samsung devices and the amazon app store does not have a lot of the same apps. Even chrome would not work on this device. I did return this because I was looking for more than a bare stock tablet. But if that's what your looking for its great!,Good tablet
3,"This is a ok tablet, worth $50 is a little slow, but for the money it's ok",Ok
3,Even though the price of the tablet matters the display and resolution should have been much better. Feels like working in the tablet without the charger connected. Amazon disappointed me with this product. Minor issues in installing the apps which are available in iOS too.,Display should have been better
3,"This tablet is good to browse the web, check emails, watch youtube videos,... The screen is small but still bigger than any smartphone.It's a bit slow but it's a good bang for the buck.Big drawback: no access to google play and no support for chromecast if you want to cast to your TV.",Tablet for basic use
3,"II like that you can undo Emails, if you accidentally deleted them.","It is OK, But I prefer the kindle Fire HDX."
3,This tablet has a great price but don't let that fool you. The tablet performs much lower that other tablets I've used.,Good tablet

3,"Great for reading, not great for playing games needs more storage.",Book lovers dream
3,Affordable tablet for kids to use. Great deal!!!!!!,Good for kids
3,"I needed an Android device to run an app no longer on the iOS App Store. I later learned it wasn't in Amazon's store so I had to install a work around. Got the Play store, downloaded the app and deleted the Play store. It wouldn't be my first choice in tablets but it doesnwhat I purchased it for and does it better than I expected. I don't appreciate the lack of security and encryption but I intentionally leave private info off the device so it doesn't impact me.",Slow and no Google App Store but dirt cheap
3,"Amazon Kindle needs to put more effort in their tablets, not a lot of applications compatible with the Amazon OS but for 50 dlls is totally worth.",Good for $50
3,"This is an OK tablet for the price. Does is able to do a lot of things like a more expensive tablet, but I find it to be slow. I bought it mainly as a reader, so am not to concerned about the other apps, etc. Is handy to carry in a purse for reading on the go. I have hooked it up to public wifi and seems to work OK, did not do much as don't know if any security there.",OK tablet
3,replacement for broken screen tablet on grandson's tablet...he's happy,Kid is happy again
3,I bought this for the offline movie download capability. When I travel it is amazing,Great for travel
3,"We switched from an older model tablet to this simplified Kindle Fire. For the price, it is a decent reader, which is primarily what we were seeking, but it has its limitations.The primary user in the house used it to read before bed. He feels the lowest brightness setting is still too bright, so he defaults his books/documents to black screen. However, words in italics default to the screen background, which means they are black. Doh!He also doesn't like the persistence of the Washington Post popping up on his Home Screen. He finds it a bit annoying. However, he doesn't mind the ads and suggested content from Amazon at all. it is just the Washington Post that he doesn't like.Beyond those minor things, it is an inexpensive and feature rich ereader. Being Amazon Prime customers, we share content between our accounts with ease now that we both are on Kindle platform.",It is a good value for the price
3,Great tablet fast and great resolution. Great with prime membership,Great tablet easy tip use
3,"I purchased this for my mother to use primarily to check Facebook and watch Netflix. I was a little bit disappointed to find out that there was not a Vudu app available. I hope that one is in the development stages. I knew that this was not a full out tablet when I bought it, but had hoped that since it was based on Android, it would have the major Android apps.",Glorified eReader
3,"I mainly use this tablet to read my kindle books on but it also handles playing music and watching videos fine. Great for social media as well. A perfect first tablet for someone who has yet to experience a tablet or smart mobile technology. Definitely buy a decent sized micro SD card when you get it though, as the real space you receive after purchase is more like 4 GB because the OS takes so much space on the device.",Good beginner tablet
3,"I bought this when it was on sale, and my rewards coupon was expiring so I felt I didn't have much to lose. Overall, this tablet is a good value, but you have to be careful about certain aspects.The tablet is really fast for something in this price range. The screen has pretty good resolution as well. There is no Bluetooth connectivity so keyboards and wireless headphones won't work with it.The app store is the Amazon app store. I side loaded Google Play and am getting my apps from there (YouTube helpful for instructions). The lock screen is an Amazon billboard. The default search is Bing instead of Google. I haven't figured out how to fix that yet. I just use the Google app to search Google. You can load the Chromecast app from Play, but it is hit or miss as to whether it works. It works for YouTube and Flixter, but it doesn't work for any Disney Apps (Watch ESPN, Watch ABC, etc.). You can cast the screen and view things that way, but the resolution is limited to the resolution of the tablet's screen.I think it was a good deal since it was cheap, and I can now watch my Prime Movies on it. Still, it's not the tablet you would expect from an Android device. My satisfaction would improve greatly if Chromecast worked better.","Decent hardware, not the best Android experience"
3,Like it. Worth the 50 $ just wish it only had a real Google play store,Ok for the price
3,"This tablet screen and memory is lackluster at best but other than that if you are replacing another one of the Kids tablets or giving a gift to an older family member this is the way to go. The video on Amazon website shows a better picture while streaming video, Amazon ""One touch"" is turned on automatically so be careful to password protect purchases unless you don't mind a lot of $2.99 purchases. In short they make it too easy to purchase items by mistake. I thought I was on Prime video and notice that I was charged for an episode of Warehouse 13. Since I didn't see the show and caught this quickly I was able to chat with Amazon Customer Care and they walked me through how to change that setting online. This tablet not for me since I'm looking for a higher end media tablet with more memory than the 8GB this unit has.",Great for kids or first time tablet user
3,It's ok I would recommend it to friends for sure in the future,Ok
3,I purchased the tablet as a screen for my drink and it worked just fine,Great product for its price
3,Bought this to replace a broken tablet hoping it would work for a replacement. Unless you are amazon everything. Google apps aren't easily installed on this tablet. Otherwise it's a great value for the money.,Great for Amazon only users
3,Movee very slow but it is ok for the price that i paid for it.,Ok but i expected more.
3,"I think this tablet is better for simple usage. Not so much for a whole lot of apps and games, as the memory is used up SUPER FAST for only being 8GB (when in reality you don't get the full 8GB to begin with). I got this for my 7yr old daughter and the apps eat up the memory which eventually slow down the tablet and make it kick off the wifi because there isn't enough memory for it to fully function. You pretty much HAVE to get a memory card for it with atleast 16GB or more. But for a starter and for basic stuff...checking social media etc it's fine. And for a starter tablet for kids.",Okay for Starter
3,"This is a great product and I did research it before buying 3 of them. Having said that, I didn't realize the apps such as Instagram and Madden mobile, we're not available on Amazon. This was a BIG disappointING factor for the young people using the product. The other big complaint we have with this product is the length of the charging cord. WAY TOO SHORT.",Easy to get around
3,Bought this tab for the $40 dollar sale price and its a nice little system. Nothing worthy of note though I have to say I am not a fan of the amazons operating system. My wife hates the inability to delete preinstalled bloatware so the home-screen is not OCD friendly.,S'allright
3,"It is a nice tablet for the price. The camera is not that great but it is decent. Beware of the memory capacity though. It says that it holds 8 gb but only has 3.81 gb of free space, so less than half.",Nice tablet for the price but not a lot of memory
3,I got these for my 4 and 8 year old. They love them,Good for kids
3,"Works okay for what we paid. Not super speedy, quality is a little grainy as well",Okay tablet for the price
3,This item is taking forever to charge and not holding the charge. We may have to return. I assume it is this unit and not all.,Great piece for the price if it works correctly.
3,This tablet is showing it's age. I bought one for my 10 year old back when he was 7 and it was cool then. Picked up two on sale for my 4 and 5 year old so they can leave my phone alone and they like it. However it's slow when downloading apps and I constantly have to plug in my pin. Battery life isn't that great either especially when they stream movies so i still have to give up my phone . Overall still a decent product hood picture and they like it.,Cool tablet for the kids
3,The main reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it's no iPad. It will be great for kids mostly. The screen quality is not the best.,Good
3,Not a bad basic tablet but is slow when loading apps,Not a bad basic tablet
3,I hate the ads. They are annoying and you cannot get them off. It's super confusing how to even get to the home page,Ads
3,"I purchased this tablet because I saw that it was at an affordable price point for me. With this, it's really not that bad. The only 2 things I've found to be able a little bit annoying is that it's a little awkward to hold/handle when I'm playing my games. The second issue I've found with this type of tablet is that it's made out of plastic & its noisy. The overall performance is quite impressive though. Good price point, with good intentions, just a little cheap feeling & a little big in the hands to hold.","Great, but has some kinks."
3,not as good as the first kindle fire I got and ok product.,ok
3,Good purchase for the money but the screen is smaller than I anticipated.,Works well but is very small
3,Had to return TWO tablets b/c they had dead pixels. Third was fine!,ok after I got one.....
3,I cant comment much on the operation of this device as it was bought as a gift. But the price is super and past experience with Kindle readers promices you will get a excellent bang for the buck.,A nice tablet for little coin

3,"The price is something you can't beat... but it can be misleading.Pretty much every function and app required you to buy something, not much you can do for free. But still worth it for such low price.","Misleading, but worth it"
3,Hard to figure out to use this tablet can't figure out how to close apps. Also says no storage to run wifi. Lastly bought three of them and one is not working wish it came with a user guide,Nice graphics
3,Good tablet for kids 10+ . My wife uses it to read on long drives,Not a bad buy
3,"You get what you pay for with this kindle fire. Excellent as a Kindle for reading books, but not great for using the Internet.

3,"For under $50, it's cheap and so so with stocked firmware BUT you can root it then put a new custom firmware on it, After such you are no longer have many annoying pop up and adware from Amazon and I feel like my Fire Table is now worth at leat 2 times more than what I have paid for it.",It's cheap and so so with stocked firmware BUT...
3,"This is a competent tablet at a bargain price. Unfortunately it is crippled by a useless operating system. Amazon's take on Android essentially removes all functionality that makes Android great, to force you to use their services and apps INSTEAD of Google's.If you're a tinkerer or don't mind doing some software hacking, this is a pretty easy fix. You can hack Google's apps and services back into it, resulting in an amazing, and amazingly cheap Android tablet.Unless you're willing to do, or hire someone to do, those software modifications, you'll probably be disappointed. If you are, it'll be the best cheap tablet you'll ever own.It looks like it might be great for kids, even in its stock state. I don't have kids, so I could not test that. But I added a star for that possibility.Unmodified: 2 starsModified: 5 stars","Useless software, great hardware for the price"
3,Even after reading the reviews about it being slow I decided to go head any purchase it. Didn't thick it was going to be this slow,Tablet is slow
3,You get what you pay for. Definitely not an iPad but they work great for our kids,It's a $40 tablet

3,"Its a good tablet with very nice screen and functions. As with amazon fire tablets , you are stuck with apps on amazon and you may not get too many variety and good quality apps. If you are ok with Amazon apps, this is a fine nice tablet.. If you need good and verities of apps, go for android tablet.",It does its job.
3,Works as good as it should for the price. Its a little outdated...but for streaming tv and books its ok,Great for kids

3,It runs pretty slow. I wish it ran a faster then it would be great,It's good for my niece who's 7
3,Bought unit on black friday as a gift. It's good thus far. Wish it was easier to get back to the home screen. Other than that I like the unit,good buy

3,"Small table for a small price comparable to other tablet options on the market but not as user-friendly as I'd hoped. I prefer Samsung and the Google Playstore. Initial set up took a while citing the table to could not locate WIFI but it was on an accessible and in use by other devices at the same moment with accessibility for the Fire tablet to also connect. Eventually it connected but the ability to use the tablet, functions, tools, etc with ease was disappointing to myself (adult) and child I purchased it for. However it's a great ""first-time"" tablet and priced well.",Small tablet for a small price
3,Everything seems to work as intended. The available storage is small when you include the pre loaded apps. I should have known that would be the case.,It works

3,Kindle fire is good because of the other things you can do besides just reading books. But it is slow and hard to read in sun.,Kindle does a lot at a good price
3,It's exactly what you would expect for a tablet under $100. Very basic. Screen resolution if sub par for what's out today. Speed is questionable but works for our 2 year old.,Standard tablet for kids
3,"good product. bought it for somebody else, so i spent little time on it.",great for beginner
3,"Works great until....... I had forgotten that Amazon fire did not come with Google Playstore. I looked up how to add Playstore to the 7"" Fire. There are many videos on YouTube that showed how to add Playstore to the fire. All seemed to add it OK but the loss performance of the Fire was noticeable. There were several apps that failed to work at all or lost features. One example was Lifetime. It was slow to load and failed to bring up Chromecast. One reason I hoped for this app would work was my Samsung and Vizio SMART TV's don't offer this app. I found a old tablet I had forgotten I had. I loaded Lifetime and works perfect. I guess what it boils down to, it you are after apps on the Playstore, get a non Amazon tablet. It is just easier to use, apps should work and you don't have to fool around trying to adapt Playstore. If Playstore isn't critical, then I'm sure this a a great little table.",Lack of Google play store.
3,"This is a fully functional tablet for under $1000. Yes it is slow, yes it works. For my child it is fine. If you are looking for something to be fast, slick, improve your productivity - you will need to spend more money.",Great for price.
3,Good tablet but it does not include google play like i was told it does by an associate in your store,Good Tablet but has a flaw
3,Based on the price it is easy to see that this tablet is not something that will knock your socks off but is good for children that like to read books.,Not the best tablet
3,"purchased to use as a reader. Was told that it had Play Store and after many attempts, we couldn't get it to work properly",ok for a first tablet
3,"The Fire Tablet has an Android operating system but is not like using an Android phone. Amazon's software makes the tablet more cumbersome to use and the tablet will often freeze. Also, you cannot download Apps from Google Play you have to get them from the Amazon App Store. There are several Apps from Amazon that you cannot remove even if you do not use them. Would not recommend without having Amazon Support.",OK Tablet
3,It is inexpensive tablet. The sound is not great too quiet.It is not the best but it is good price.,It is a good tablet
3,Tablet was reasonably priced. Would say it's a starter tablet for kids. Kind of slow on response but the kids enjoy it.,Good for kids only.
3,I bought this for my toddler to keep her busy on road trips or at appointments and she wasn't too fond of it. It's kinda slow and limited to what you can do. One feature I did like is that you can set a profile for kids and they'll only be able to use apps that you designate for them to use.,"It's ok, but nothing like an iPad"
3,"my kids get a lot of use out of their tablets. however, I wish the battery life was better.",kid friendly

3,"If you were looking for a tablet thats cheap, this is it. Great for watching netflix",Cheap tablet for netflix
3,My 2 year old loves this thing. Uses it mostly for Netflix. Major issue with this is that it barely has any memory. It is very limited as to what and how much you can put on it.We have about 10 apps/games or less and Netflix app. It will not allow anything more as it has no space.,Lacking memory
3,"Decent product. It's definitely not for anyone who wants a tablet to stream or play games (other than amazon prime and laggy games) but it's OK for internet browsing and general use. It's on the lowest end of the tablet prices, so you get what you pay for",Works for the price
3,When purchased it wouldnt turn on. After doing some research everyone said theirs did that after dropped or being dropped in water. I FINALLY got it to come on.,Its okay
3,I started out liking the tablet but having to change a lot of the settings. It works good but I really did not like the advertisements that were appearing.,Tablet is okay for the price
3,"This is definitely not an iPad or a high end tablet. Nevertheless, for the discounted price that i paid on it (so, less than $50), it is well worth getting. I wanted something bigger while waiting for the next iPad Air to come out, and this fits the bill for paying little and getting a basic low end tablet. It is geared towards Amazon media consumption, ad it does that decently even with a screen resolution less than HD. If the sale comes back again where it is $15 off, I would not hesitate to recommend it again.",Excellent for the price you pay
3,Bought this in thanksgiving sale. It's a great loss price tablet at the sale price but would not buy it for regular price. Would go for HD model instead by playing a bit extra though.,Great low price tablet
3,Don't know much about this item. I purchased it on Black Friday for my niece. Hope she likes it.,Was a gift
3,"I purchased these for my grandchildren, ages 3 to 9. Not a lot of power/performance but great for the kids. They have downloaded books from amazon and viewed movies on Netflix. One downfall was my Grandson could not connect his tablet to his MiP's robot he received for Christmas. Would not recommend this tablet to those seeking computer performance like that of the large more functional tablets like Samsung Dell and others",Great for young school age kids
3,"I was looking for a Kindle Fire because I have had other android tablets in the past and most times the Kindle app makes them crash or takes up too much space on the tablet. I like it for reading but it isn't as great for other things and you are not allowed to have the Google Play store on it because that competes with the Amazon app store. However, not all apps are available on the Amazon app store so this was an immediate drawback for me. I will keep this and use it but in the future I will not buy Kindle tablets again.",Kindle Fire
3,Not as good as the HDX but does well for $50. Also much slower than HDX. Screen is more pixelated than anticipated. Would probably spend more next time and get a quicker unit.,You get what you pay for

3,I actually ended up returning this item because I got frustrated with the adds. If it wasn't for that I probably would have given it 5 stars.,Too Many Adds
3,"The sales rep told me this kindle Fire tablet is easy to set up. Just follow the directions. Three hours later + a trip back to the store, a member of the Geek Squad finally got my e mail to work. He could not tell me why it was a problem. Also the camera quality is very poor. If you use it to check your e mails and browse the web, its fine. Other than that.... oh well.",Frustration++++
3,It was an okay purchase for my 6 year old. I definitely wouldn't pouches it for myself. Not much you can do on it.,OK purchase
3,It's different than android system's. And to be honest I prefer android.,good
3,while the price was great the tablet is filled with advertising and is getting slower and slower with usage...,great price

3,"Definitely not as smooth as hoped, then again for the price. But internet browser was really bad and you can't add chrome out the box",It was only ok
3,"the screen is mediocre. the processor is good, very little storage. and you have to deal with ads, every time you turn on the screen. You can pay to have them removed. for that price you can get a better screen, more storage and open ecocistem. that is not tied only to amazon",ordinary. It's the only thing I can say about this
3,"You cannot beat the price on this tablet, but there is no bluetooth. Also, it really hits you hard with advertising and trying to get you to do everything through amazon. We bought it to use in the kitchen with our digital cookbooks.",Good price
3,"I bought this tablet to connect to my hdtv. After not being able to get it to connect, I called Amazon customer care who informed me that this model doesn't connect to the tv, but the previous model (4th generation) does and that I should purchase the Amazon fire stick. Why the newer model does less...who knows. If you want to watch movies just on the tablet then it's a great buy, but didn't work for my purposes.",Does not connect to tv
3,"My mother has the larger Amazon tablet, which prompted me to purchase this version. The tablet screen seemed smaller than a standard 7' tablet, so I returned it.",Too small
3,"This tablet does what it supposed to do, however, if you have one of the newer smart phones with a large screen there just isn't enough difference in the screen size to justify a second piece of equipment.","Works great, just small"
3,restricts use of some web pages- including barnes and nobles where I have a library- useless to read the books in my Barnes library,OK TABLET MAJOR SHORTFALL
3,"My old Kindle Fire got pushed into the water by my cat, so I bought a new one. It's OK, but nothing to write home about. Kinda of slow and the size is a little awkward.....too narrow. It'll do, and the price is right, but if you can afford more, buy a better tablet.","OK, not great"
3,The tablet works only when it wants too. I have to restart it all the time for it to work properly. Only have 2 weeks with it and the youtube app sucks it doesn't work properly,Cant expect a lot

3,I have an IPad but thought I would buy this Black Friday to play around with and program to give to my Mother to enjoy.,Works well
3,This is an average performance tablet and amazon centric. This tablet could have been better if amazon would have made it with android os instead of poorly designed fire OS. The app store and apps in that are not great. This tablet can be good for people who wants to read while travel or play some games while travel will be good. I paid only 35$ so cant complain for the price i paid. I already have ipad mini 2 and comparing with that makes this tablet little slow.,Average Performance - Dont Expect too much
3,"Tablet is ok. It does display ads on the lock screen, that you can't opt out of, to my knowledge. But for the price, I can't really complain. I bought it at the $35 BF price. I wouldn't let me download Instagram for some reason either.",good for price
3,Well primarily I was going. To for a Samsung galaxy but for the price I went with this kindle for my daughter to use I do like the parental control features I just wish Amazon was a full android device instead of limitations to app markets I can't even get Google play. Unless you jail break it. Well for what it does it works fine just not the top of the list.,kindle used as a kids tablet
3,Amazon adds are annoying. Lack of compatibility with Google and other apps is annoying. Price is great. Nice to have but it really isn't better than other tablets out there.,Ok but definitely not great
3,Does not pick up WiFi very well; apps take longer to download...However regular software apps work great!,Kindle is Good but the WiFi Capability not so good
3,"Like most Androd devices, has slowed down considerably over time since purchase. Nice for video watching but browsing the Internet is slow at times. Apps take awhile to load good for the price",It's okay
3,"This tablet handles the basics including email, Facebook, web browsing and utube. No comparison to theiPad though.,",Satisfsctory for the price
3,"I purchased the new Kindle Tablet not really knowing what to expect..I didn't read any reviews before hand, nor did I try the one in store. After getting home, charging, and applying updates I noticed there are numerous bright/stuck pixels at least 8. It's only noticeable on dark screens. I understand the devices limitations verses price but you would expect to at least have a functional screen with maybe 1 pixel issue at most.As I mentioned above when you plug it in and turn it on it immediately starts an update, that process took a good thirty minutes to complete. Upon first boot I went to register with my Amazon account but it returned some funky error message, I tried again and it said the device was already registered, so I was unable to complete the setup/walk through. I'm a very technical user so this wasn't too big of an issue, but I could see where it could be for someone that isn't savvy with computers/tablets.All that said in use, it runs decently, and def better then you would expect a Tablet at this price point to run. It's not a power house per-se but for what it's built for, consumption device, it does everything from play movies, music and casual games with out a hitch. The UI is realitivley snappy as well.Pros:- Price- IPS Screen viewable at most angles- Works well with the Amazon eco systemCons:- Mono sound (1 speaker poorly placed on back of unit)- Stuck Pixels out of the box- Low Resolution- Device registration issuesIn closing I would recommend to friends as long as they understand it's limitations.",Numerous stuck pixels
3,"It works great. Not affected by the singular WiFi band at all.Battery life is amazing.Just be sure you can get the apps you'd like from the appstore, google play isn't accessible. So if you're looking for Snapchat, Instagram, NBC, Comcast, Vudu, you won't get those here.Returning it. Which is too bad, I really enjoyed it. More bang for the buck if you could access those apps. But like I said, it was my fault for not checking first. I was expecting the 'apps from unknown sources' to kick in but it so didn't.","Works, just view appstore 1st"
3,I don't care for the lack of storage or the strange arrangement and naviagation through the software. Nonetheless it's nice for its price,Kind of slow but decent overall
3,got it to play games or get info when waiting at dr app,tab
3,Bought it as birthday gift for my son. He didn't like it at first because he is ise to the Android system. He likes it more now that he's figured it out and for the price it's ok.,Nice tablet for my 12 year old

3,"I wouldn't buy again, had trouble w/shutting off all the time, we would have it reset back to the factory reset status and it would lock up and freeze, actually replaced with second thinking that was just a bad one however sad to report same problems. Not a favorite purchase.",Shuts down randomly
3,I've been spoiled by Apple. I bought the tablet for my son so he could have his own. He still uses his sister's iPod and iPad and they are years old.I would only recommend this to families that don't own apple products.,Worth the price but not an iPad
3,Its a good tablet for my 6 yr old to play games and watch videos. Only thing is the charger doesnt stay in the port and battery doesnt last long,Good for my child

3,I wish it has some more of the apps from the play store some are just not there,Fits perfectly in my hand
3,I bought this a first tablet. I'm disappointed in the battery life. I sort of expected better especially as I got hooked on online games.,Great First Tablet
3,"Serves the purpose for which it was bought, ; I.e. Facebook",Good price
3,"I ordered this online on black Friday, I live about 30 miles from nearest store and I saw the special on their website, so why not I thought. Came in yesterday. Maybe it's just because I'm not familiar with this product; I'm used to Android tablets that have you set up with your Google account. This one you set up with your Amazon account. OK, no big deal I thought, at first. Then I found it very difficult to install the free 6 month Webroot it came with. I went to Google Play as instructed, it says installed, but there is no Open button to click to continue the process, as instructed. When I contacted Amazon customer support, I was told I can't use Google Play on it and to use the app store instead. I was given a link for Webroot installation but it didn't help. I downloaded Google Chrome but can't find it on the device. No youtube, facebook, gmail apps; won't install. Again, maybe I'm just not used to the product but if I can't use Google apps on it, I won't like this. It's actually for my son and even though teens are often smarter than we adults when it comes to gadgets, LOL, I don't think he will like this either. So I'm returning this; hopefully can find an Android tablet I like (and affordable) at Best Buy.",Confusing for me; returning

3,I do like the Fire Tablet - but I feel that if it is going to have a camera it should have been a better camera. The internet works but I find it takes a while to load. I have read a book on it but - I prefer to use my original paper white - that can be read in any lighting including outside.

The OS is a bit clunky, and less intuitive then on higher priced tablets, but tough to beat the price. Speed isn't great for web or certain gaming apps, but fine for books. Parental controls are helpful, but take time to figure out and require more steps than seem necessary to change. Overall, OK first tablet for kids, considering the price.

3,No instructions. Either paper or electronic. How do I transfer apps & data from old kindle to new one 9,Kindle HD
3,"Overall it's a nice looking cover and does it's job well. It's simple, elegant and slick. When I say slick, I don't necessarily mean cleverly devised, I mean slippery. The smooth leather provides next to no grip on the cover. I have a tendency to hold things lightly, so I can just imagine this repeatedly slipping out of my hand. Sure it doesn't have a band/clasp/etc to keep it closed, but neither did Kindle 2's cover, and neither does nearly every book ever published.It's too expensive. I don't understand why Amazon is charging so much considering they'll be offering another cover with additional functionality for half the price (AmazonBasics Leather Folio Cover with Multi-Angle Adjustable Stand for Kindle Touch, Kindle (Black)). What the heckPros:PrettyFunctionalCons:SlipperyExpensive",Slick
3,"The Touch cover from Amazon has some good and some bad properties.On the good side, it's very light: at 4 oz it is noticeably lighter than the previous generation of covers. My Kindle Touch fits in very snugly with no wasted space.On the negative side, it looks and feels rather plasticky. I ordered the plain black version and the front and back outer covers are a shiny black leather. At first I thought the back exterior was simply black plastic, and it took a close examination to realize it is the same leather as the front cover. The front inner cover is a soft felt. The inner body where the Kindle sits is plastic. There is no fastener or band to hold the cover closed.This is my fourth Kindle and cover. The Touch cover looks much more like a gadget cover than the earlier ones. It looks rather like an old Palm PDA cover I had, or like some ipod covers. The previous Kindle covers had a textured leather appearance and they looked more like book or notebook covers.Right now I am having rather mixed reactions. I definitely like the fact that it adds so little weight to the Kindle. However it does look rather cheap. For 40 I was expecting a little more.I think I am going to have to use this for a while before reaching a final conclusion.Update November 29th: Tastes will vary, but in the end I decided that this was not the right look or feel for me and I have switched to a different cover (the Splash SAFARI). That is similar to the old Kindle 3 cover, with a textured leather appearance and an elastic fastener strap.","Very light, but looks a little plasticky"

3,This was easy to setup and easy to hand over to my 4 yr old. She loves the different games and apps that are available to her.,Great for kids
3,"At first I wanted to return this product, I bought it for my 2 yr old. I decided to keep it bc my husband liked it and of course my daughter likes it. I dnt like the fact you cant use the audible app on the kids version. I also bought it so my daughter could be independent, as far as the books none of them are read aloud. She came maneuver the games and movies tho. Its an ok product tho, I love Amazon. My daughter still likes my Samsung Tab better. Would recommend for older kids.",My daughter likes it
3,Overall I wasn't too impressed with his tablet. Actually returned it for an iPad mini bc my kid like it better and it was easier to use.,Not too kid friendly
3,"These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft, yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case. The only thing I wish, was that it could access the Google Play Store so my kids could watch the movies we have in our Google Play Movies account.",Great for the kids... no Google Play Store
3,returning for a replacement. It got wet and quite working for a child's device it should be better made.,Device is not as rugged as it could be returning
3,Good for alittle ones for games and movies picture not so clear but not expensive,Great for small kids
3,Son loves it........................................,Great for kids
3,"I'm a big fan of Amazon and their products, but this tablet is just ok. The build quality is great and the image is very good, but the software is mediocre at best. Worth the price.",Just OK
3,I did read about the game prior to buying it but so far the game is only half decent. Too much of the same thing.,Decent game so far
3,Battery doesn't last the up to 7 hours estimate. Didn't even last 4 hours one day. Watches video mostly but should last longer than that.,Battery sucks
3,"I purchased this for my 4 year old to play. It was not as user friendly as described and VERY slow. It keeps pausing and freezing up, which is frustrating for anyone using it. I was told that I would receive 20 off of the prime subscription, however, that was not offered when registering this product. It may be good for some, but it was not a good fit for us.",Not what I was looking for
3,"I love these Tablets, but the charging ports aren't the best. I bought 3 for Christmas and my kids take excellent care of them. I also do NOT them touch the tablets while they are charging. They have only had their tablets since Christmas day and they won't charge. I highly recommend getting the protection warranty for this item.",Charging Ports
3,I'll give it 3 starts because it's a decent tablet. But if the screen messes up when I'm trying to use it i can't imagine how my granddaughter feels.,Not as good as I'd hoped
3,Needs to be more simpler. parental contorl still need to be better,kids fun
3,"This is the 2nd one I have bought. The first one went out before the 1 year. I contacted Amazon and the warranty for these was only 90 days. It is a good tablet for kids, but if you are looking for something long term. I would spend the extra $$ for at least something that has a 1 year limited warranty.",Very good table for the price
3,"My toddler did not like this tablet. It was a bit slow for her. Instead, she preferred an iPad over the Kindle Kids version.",Processor is slow
3,Only good for kids and games. Battery life is good.,Great for kids
3,It was ok. You need Internet. The SDmini is a hassle.,Kids Tablet
3,"I have a few issues with this tablet. Mainly the fact that I can't get Google services on it, not even YouTube. Aside from that, the biggest downfall is the charging. The port is very loose and comes undone easily and the charge doesn't hold for very long.",Sturdy Tablet
3,"Tablet is great. I am trying to get my daughter use to the kindle. We started her at 10 months on an Ipad and thought it would be easier to get one her own tablet now that she is almost 2. Not so, she is struggling to navigate in the kindle. I am not able to transfer her games and movies.","Great tablet, just not for my daughter"
3,It's ok but I rather have bought Samsung Galaxy Tab,Good
3,Christmas gift for 8 yr. Ended up returning. too slow and not enough content for our 8 yr old. Kids....... Great 2yr protection tho,Good for little kids
3,"I bought this for my 2-year old. She liked it for the first few days and then she went back to playing with my ipad. If I hadn't already introduce her to the ipad, I think she would have been fine with this.",Not bad
3,Perfect for that age group that I bought it for she 10and loves it.,The camera and Cover are great
3,"Good for little kids, it runs a little slow though",not bad
3,"Works fine on wifi, otherwise a little slow. My kid enjoys it though. For the price it's good.","Decent, does the job"
3,"This looked easy, but hard to setup if no experience with other than Apple products",Good product but hard to setup for Grandson
3,"It's nice to have parental controls, but app grouping and bugs with apps hurts the experience. Parents will still need to look over child's shoulder to ensure games/apps are appropriate. Battery life is absolutely terrible.",It's ok.
3,"Thought this would be perfect for my two children. The case, warranty and pass to download unlimited apps seemed great. However, the pad is sometimes unresponsive and inaccurate-which can be frustrating for children. The case is a little too bulky. And it can be confusing for children who want to push an icon to play but it instead downloads. There is a definite learning curve that they will overcome in time but it could be more user friendly for younger users.",alright tablet
3,I absolutely love how u. An switch from dif accounts,Love kids mode
3,My 4yr old was able to operate it flawlessly. The included case works its magic to keep the tablet from any accidental screen cracks.,Easy setup
3,The tablet is for my son who is 2. That being said I noticed blotches on the screen. Never returned it due to it not making a difference to my son. I will have to upgrade him in question few years anyway. The bumper is amazing.,Great bumper
3,"Good tablet. Easy to use for 5 yr. Not as many free stuff as expected. Have to pay for most games, movies and books.",Good tablet for kids
3,The tablet could be great for my 4 year old daughter if it worked properly. As of right now I need to return it to see if a new one will work. There are black and grey lines across the screen most of the time. It will not go to the home screen so my daughter can play on it. I am hoping a new one will not be faulty.,Could be a great tablet
3,"I was hoping he would not want to put it down, like the other tablet he had (sprout chubby )But he stills wants my phone.",Nice size
3,Good tablet to take for my child to play on when out to dinner. Keeps him busy.,Good for nights out
3,"I got 2 of this for kids 5 and 3 it is a pretty good tablet, easy to navigate for the children but (and this is on me for not researching) but kid content is only free for a year, after that you gotta pay a monthly fee which is cheaper if you are a prime member, but still...Now reason why I'm about to return them! You CANNOT get YouTube kids at all! No google apps. You can get some YouTube kids clones on the adult profile and add them to the kid's profile but they stink. They're full of commercials.So I wasn't expecting this tablet to be like an iPad but this is a deal breaker for me.","Mom review, no techie stuff."
3,Wish it was easier to understand set up so children don't accidently charge to my account.,Difficult to learn how to play some of the games
3,I bought it and wrapped it up immediately. So I couldn't say either way if it was good or not.,I bought it as a gift
3,"I bought 2 of these tablets for my two youngest children. They had a lot of options to chose from as far as children apps go, but they were already familiar with the iPad since they stole mine all the time. Lol. That made it hard for them as well as myself to figure out how to use at first. Besides that, it's a good product.",Kind of complicated
3,"This is one of the perfect tab for kids, I bought it for my niece and she loved it.",Perfect Tab
3,A few problems with games loading but over all good,Kids loved it
3,"Good features for kids, but definitely not enough storage. You'll need to get an SD card and set things to download to that or it will freeze and stop working.",Not enough storage
3,I would would not recommend this for a child. It's not kid friendly at all. I have purchased 4 of them for my grandson and nephews and 3 was was damaged within a couple months. I think this product is is a better fit for adults.,Not kid friendly
3,This is going to be a Christmas gift for my granddaughter so we don't know how good it is yet but we where going to put so games on it so it is ready to go and we couldn't because you have to have a amazon account to do anything with it.,It is a Christmas gift
3,There's not much difference in the regular Kindle. Wait till it goes on sale.,Wait till it goes on sale.
3,We found there to be too many pop up ads and returned it.,Too many pop up ads
3,I would recommend this tablet for an older child. Maybe 7 and up.,"Good, but not great"
3,it was great for reading but the lag time for loading videos was a little bit longer than an iPad,kindle kids fire
3,I love this tablet and the games. But battery sucks. It goes dead really fast and it freezes up a lot.,Great for kids
3,Limited activities for my son to surf the web and do the things he likes to do!,Great for a kid
3,"I was completely under the impression that this tablet was child friendly but there are no built in restrictions so my son was able to purchase numerous apps and movies. My son usually uses my wife's ipad so I thought this tablet would be a good replacement but the interface is geared towards adults not a young child. If you buy this tablet, IMMEDIATELY change the settings to require a PIN to make purchases.I think the age recommendation should be 5+ not 3+.",No automatic restrictions for children
3,"Kids will love this tablet, has a camera and kids can make movies with it. Wonderful for a child with a good imagination","love this product, easy and fun for kids!"
3,"I bought this for my 8year old son, he loves it just has very limited games on it",good starter tablet
3,You get what you pay for. Playtime works when it wants to. Went on a long trip and the videos we downloaded had issues playing most of the time. My son is almost 2. He gets bored of it quickly. The pros are the price and it is well protected externally.,So so
3,"This product works, but works slow compared to Apple and some Android phones/tablets. Like I stated in my summary... you pay for what you get. No major issues thus far.",You pay for what you get
3,"Wish it was a bit faster loading and browsing, but functions as you would expect for kid friendly product. I would spend the extra money next time for a tablet designed for adults but had strong parental controls",Slow but good for kids
3,You get what you pay for Was not to happy but for a 3 year old it's ok,Ok
3,You get what you pay for Was not to happy but for a 2 year old it's ok,Ok
3,I bought this for my two year old grandson but the restrictions were too much.,My grandson needed more
3,Battery dies after an hour...should last longer for the money. Will not bold charge.,Kiddo LOVES it
3,I like the ipad its very helpful my son has learned alot and i hope that it will help other kids too as they prepare for pre k,I love it
3,It was working great then all of a sudden it wouldnt come on,Very disappointed
3,"I purchased 2 others for my 5 & 6yr-olds, and my 3yr-old niece enjoyed playing theirs so much I then bought this one for her. The included 1yr subscription to free-time is awsome for the kids! Parental controls are great, and included apps are helpful.The lower rating is because the charging port was extremely loose, as the cord falls out ALL the time! Very Frustrating!",Great for a Beginner
3,There is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it. The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen. This means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an iPad can do with guided access activated.,"Does what it says, missing one key feature"
3,The layout of the tablet is good. Internet is terrible.,Fair
3,Great beginner tablet for kids I would recommend it,Kids 1st tablet approved
3,I have 3 autistic kids and is great cause they can be rough .,Great kids tablet
3,I am happy so far with this tablet. It offers great protection for use with kids but is a little pricey for the lackluster performance. Great for kids.,"Great protection, decent performance"
3,Slow performance and charging port very low poor quality it gets frozen most of the times,Slow performance
3,"Very slow performance and sometimes applications freeze up and don't work very well , charging port very low quality",Very slow
3,"I bought this for my daughter. It was bundled with a solid bumper case and has a kid mode interface. She insisted on using her brother's iPad constantly. Not to say there is anything wrong with this product, it just wasn't for her.",Almost
3,My daughter lovethis tablet.. only problem is it cant connect to my home wifi which is verizon,Great tablet for toddler
3,"The tablet itself was nice, but the screen was to small for books, videos, and minecraft.",Small screen for books and videos
3,"it has great durability, but lacks great sound. The picture quality is just ok",Beginner tablet
3,Right after we bought it the charging port broke but it was very easy to get the tablet replaced and shipped to our house. It's not very operations friendly and comes with very little instruction.,Good warranty and protection
3,Great for the kids but not much space for all the apps they want.,Not bad
3,"The tablet is pretty good, I would give it 5 stars if you are able to download an use apps from the Google store, that is one of my only big complaint. And also how fast the SD card got filled with items from Amazon OS that's on the tablet without the user knowing. On the other hand, With four kids using tablets as reward time it helps the kids free time is awesome it useful",great beginners kids tablet
3,Its a nice little set up but it's slow. I wish I would have investigated them a little more before just jumping in.,I like it but....
3,Great case ok tablet no Android play store. Weak micro usb port. It's isn't an straight out the box tablet. Had to install Android play store on it. And as far as the charging port goes I'm on my 3rd one but best buy are the best with their return policy...,Tablet not for kids
3,Grandson became board with what it offers. Plug wears out fast,Good for young kids
3,"This makes for a decent tablet for a kid with the kids edition, but I'm not sure I'd want it as an adult. There are much better tablets on the market. But since it's cheap, that's to be expected.",Decent Kids Edition
3,I purchased this item for my 7yr old daughter. We like it but we can't get the pictures of the apps to show,I like it
3,"This tablet is OK, sometimes it's kind of slow. Loads for a while before opening app. Storage has been good. 32 GB. I gave my son the freedom to download any game he wanted on prime time. And after 2 months he still has like 3gb left of space. Not recommend for kids over 10 years old. My son is 4 and sometimes he gets mad because tablet gets slow. Still good deal for 32gb, 1 year primetime for $80",An OK tablet
3,It's a good piece of technology it's just not connecting to the wifi,It's a good product
3,I bought this for 3 year old to replace an older Ipad. it was functional but no where near level of ipad. This is understandable based on price difference/ I returned to store.,Not a bad product
3,This tablet is grrrrrrreeeeeeeeaaaaaattttttt for the children!,Good tablet 4 kids
3,This device is a good if you are looking for a starter tablet for a young individual.,Good for 4 year old
3,"A good starter tablet, but very very slow. Don't expect and I Pad savy child to enjoy this. But for a true beginner it would be fine.",Good but SLOW
3,volume is a problem we have to take off the protective case for it to sound clear.,It's okay
3,"Thought this came without special offers, the staff told me it didn't. Amazon had a sale on this when I bought it, and I thought I was just getting the same deal, but I had to pay $20 later to get rid of the ads",Kindle is great
3,"I bought this product for traveling for its light weight and paper like reading. It was fine with e-books, but I had some PDF file I wanted to read on it. I could load the PDFs, but hard to read. No font enlargable for PDFs. Plus, the screen is not very responsive as screens in tablets. I ended up return it.",It Is Not As Good As I Expected
3,"Love this kindle as its light, user friendly and great purchase",Great for reading
3,I set it up but haven't used it yet. Not clear how to download books but I plan to learn that this weekend.,I haven't used it yet.
3,"After using IPAD, it is weird to see flickers while reading on a small screen. However, it was recommended by a friend of mine who thinks it is easy on eyes. Battery lasts long and you can download work related pdfs to read later. (my main purpose to buy was to read docs offline) Redundant if you have kindle on ipad/other tabs.",GettingUsed
3,"I purchased this as a gift for my daughter and she loves it. Easy to read and stores all of her books. My only complaint is that it feels slow and sluggish when transitioning from one screen tk the next. Even turning the page feels slow. Not sure if it has a setting to change this but its a noticeable difference between this device and the kindle fire both with out of the bix settings. My daughter doesn't mind it and prefers the screen on the paperwhite for reading. Battery life is fantastic, its so good you can go on a weekend trip and leave the charger at home.",Purchased as a gift
3,This was a replacement for my son who's original kindle broke. He likes it a lot. Just wish we could figure out how to get all the old content we had bought from the old one into the new one.,Easy to read
3,I purchased 3 (2 as gifts) recently believing all prior purchases would be compatible with the Paperwhite. I was highly disappointed to learn that interactive solitaire and word games I played on the old Kindle Touch were lost.,Good reading
3,Excellent product nysecond one will but again love read,Foid
3,"The best reader out there - however don't expect to use this tablet for its web browser function - looks strange seeing ""paper"" versions of websites as the paper white feature cannot be turned off.",Good product
3,Have been using a tablet and find the Kindle harder to navigate.,Not what I expected
3,"The recharging port is not working consistently. I have tried other cables, so I know it's not the cable. Otherwise it works fine. I am looking forward to not having to charge it but once a week.",Great reader
3,There have been a few minor changes included in this new Kindle that I don't particularly like.Opening page is slightly confusing.,Kindle Review.
3,"This reader is purely for the person that simply wants an e-book reader, and very little else.",Perfect...If You Don't Have an iPad.
3,"I wanted a Kindle with a light feature for reading in bed at night. Had I done my homework, I would have purchased a Kindle with more bells and whistles.",I didn't do my homework.
3,I usually read in bed and found this reader to be too heavy and bulky. I originally didn't want to pay the higher price for the Voyage but I exchanged this one for the Voyage and I am much happier with it.,Exchanged for the Voyage
3,I got it to store all my college books without checking to see if they would even be compatible. They weren't. It's my fault for not checking this. The three star rating is because you can buy a good tablet for less and use the kindle app. Which is what I did. I can now read my books and have a fully functional tablet.,It's okay.
3,I didn't find the e-reader easy to navigate and actually found it confusing. I have an older model and that one is easier to navigate. The new one was skipping pages sometimes also.,It wasn't easy to use
3,"I had a lower end kindle for years. When that broke, I decide to buy the higher end one that is backlit. The back litghting is nice for reading at night. But the touch features are too jumpy--it jumps pages instead of just turning to the next one. It is cumbersome to buy through amazon and difficult to see the list of what you have. I don't know if I'd buy this one over the lowest end one again.","It's ok, but it jump pages too easily."
3,"It should be easier.to print off highlights and have a choice not.to have every location and other stuff printing with every highlight.It should be easier to erase ""All"" highlights.Regular book numbers should correlate with location.Easier.to.forward.through chapters.",Functions
3,"The Kindle Paper white is excellent for reading; however: 1. Product needs to be able to shut OFF! Very unhappy about this. Advertising says will hold charge for weeks - not so, when Kindle paperwhite cannot be shut down. It only holds a charge for a few days, if you read for a couple of hours each day. 2. I have books that I do not intend to read often and want them left in the cloud. I am finding it very close to impossible to return any of my books to the cloud - IT SHOULD BE EASIER!! Amazon made it easy to change Kindle's when I purchased a new one. All Kindle's should be user friendly. Sadly, this is not the case, with the Paperwhite.",Ok for reading
3,"Pros: The E-Ink display is easy on the eyes, very sharp. Great battery life.Cons: Dependant on Amazon's Infrastructure to manage. Because of that limitation I give it 3 stars.",It's ok ...
3,I bought this for travel so I can read as much as I can without bartering and carrying books. It's easy to read but the size doesn't work for me. I have to hold it with two hands. I was hoping I could hold it in one. In retrospect I would get the Amazon Fire instead.,Not the ideal size for me
3,"Easy to read,very sensitive to touch. Still can't figure out how to get a new book onto the device. The on/off button is tiny which presents a problem as l have long nails. Too technical for a ""book""",Confusing for a book!!
3,The Version with the light is the way to go. A case is a must the screen can easily be scratched. over works as intended,Small compact easy to carry
3,doesnot work After three weeks?I cannot open it. so sad,totally deied
3,I like the kindle it is light and easy too sue battery life is good.,nice and sleek useful with touch and whitelight
3,"You will find detailed reviews of kindle paper white online. I will cover some other general observations,If you send a pdf to your kindle email , it will sync it to your kindle. But the fonts appear small when you open it in kindle paper white and the menu option did not allow me to change font size. You have to convert the pdf to be able to adjust font size.You will be able to convert your existing pdfs by sending a email with ""Convert"" in subject line and including the attachment and sending it to your kindle email (refer to amazon settings for finding out your kindle email). However it may lose the tables or other code diagrams from the original pdf so that is a pain (varies from pdf to pdf). Also if you are used to ios or android, the page turns are not the same like flipping. when you tap or perform a page flip,It will blink for a sec and refresh the page to move to next page. I found this a little annoying but it works. if you buy a book online then that might be a better option as it will let you read the formatted content correctly.Battery usage is fantastic.Another positive is that the inbuilt lights are not glaring in the dark so you will find reading to be a pleasant experience. They have settings to adjust brightness as well.",Good device for reading books you buy.
3,"It's nice & cool but it responds extremely slow. Compared to modern tablets & phones kindle is just too slow. My expectation would be to make it faster even if I have to charge it often that would be ok, secondly there should be a Home button & back button on the body of kindle.",Nice
3,I would opt for an iPad rather than the Kindle just because of the ease of researching books by authors etc. the only advantage of the Kindle is the attractive comparative price.,Not the easiest to research and find books.
3,I have yet to figure out what page of the book I am on. Don't really care what percent of a book is left or that I have 5 minutes left in a chapter. After using a Nook for many years this is cumbersome. Good news: way easier to get library books on this.,Not the easiest reader to navigate
3,"I still haven't been able to figures out my kindle, it seems like it has very cool features but learning slowly how to take take full advantage of it.",Good for readers
3,"A reader, but the processor is not fast, react slowly",A reader
3,It's an OK product. Nothing special. Not on the cutting edge of technology,It's an OK product
3,"I've had every Kindle e-reader available. Though it doesn't have all the features available on the Voyage, the Paperwhite is the best. The issue I've had are the emergence of tiny light ""leaks"" emerging from the source through the matte textured page background. They're little pinhole-sized, bright light scattered across the page. It usually begins with just one, or two, and becomes several over time. It's distracting to reading. In a conventional book, it would be like having a small speck of dirt on the page. If these little things don't bother you, then it's not an issue. The Paperwhite models don't seem to have this problem as often as the Voyage does. I went through 3 Voyage models before surrendering and returning to the Paperwhite. The Paperwhite has fewer total lights, so it's not as evenly lit as the Voyage, however, it's nothing significant.",Inconsistent quality
3,I like it small lightweight easy to see wifi capabilities,nice
3,"Let me set the stage for this review: I joined a book club this year and have started reading a lot... or at least what I would consider to be a lot, which is about 2 decently-long books a month.Up until buying the Paperwhite, I was doing most of my reading on my iPhone using the Kindle app. Long story short, I ended up returning the Paperwhite after about 2 weeks. Why? Because I realized just how sporadic my reading was. I read when I'm out and about, waiting at a doctor's office, or in-line at a restaurant, etc. It became overwhelmingly apparent to me that the best E-Reader is the one you have with you at all times. For me, that's my iPhone.The actual reading experience is definitely better on the Paperwhite. However, if you're an ""on-the-go"" reader like me, then it just means you have to carry around another device. Dedicated E-Readers are for people who either truly read a ton, or have a set routine for reading. If that's not you, then stick with your phone.",You better read a ton
3,"Battery life is great. Kindle unlimited is lame, web browser needs work.",Not bad
3,"An 'okay' reader. Reading from an iPad mini is better under all conditions except outside in sunlight. Plus, with the iPad you can play games, web search, etc. The Kindle library function is not nearly as good as the Kindle app on the iPad where you can see many more of your books on a page and scroll through them all quickly versus the slow swipe function of the Kindle. I also do not like the page turn of the Kindle versus Apple. Every page turned on Kindle is like slow motion and about every fifth page refreshes entirely. I actually have to go to the top of the next page slowly in order to not have to wait for the Kindle slow page turn. Even the reading in the outdoors feature of the Kindle is not as great as reviewers indicate as there is still the sun glare on pages that you have to deal with, although at least you can read with it outdoors. The Kindle also suffers from a 'shadow' along the bottom of the screen. The explanation is that it is actually a shadow that is between the lights that are shining upward for night time reading. Draw your own conclusions as to whether that is good engineering. It is worse on some of the devices I saw than on others. Kindle serves the purpose for reading at the beach and not worrying if it accidently gets damaged. I would never take an iPad to the beach, but the Kindle is almost 'disposable' in contrast. Maybe 3 stars is being a bit generous but it is a good supplement to the iPad. If Apple ever makes their device so it can be used outside without a glare, then I don't see any market for the Kindle at that point. Not sorry I have a Kindle, but for what I decided to buy it for (reading at beach) it is at the price point where it is not really worth it. I still read ""paper"" books for those who remember what those are and those still work perfectly for beach reading.",Not as great as reviewers rate it.
3,I enjoy this kindle. I was disappointed that the iPad gloss made it difficult to read outdoors at the beach but this paper white makes that very possible.,Good for beach reading
3,The screen was small for me and I couldn't access a website with free ebooks. I ended up taking it back and read on my iPad now.,Eh
3,Bought this for a friend in the hospital.very easy for him to use as he uses it endless hrs.the picture quality is good also ..would buy product again,"Good item ,easy to use"
3,Good for the price. Ended up returning it for the model up that had some extra features.,Ok e reader
3,I liked my Kindle fire better. Kindle Fire was easier to hold and easier to use.,okay but there must be better options avaiiable
3,I am glad I bought it. It is easy to use and have given me good book suggestions.,"nice size, took some getting use to"
3,"I had to replace my Kindle 3G keyboard after several years because it would no longer charge. So I got this one and I'm satisfied, but I really miss my 3G. The only feature that's better in the newer Kindle is the light. Turning pages is my main complaint with the touch screen. It sometimes doesn't register the touch and you have to do it again. Also going back a page is a pain. Supposedly the left 25% of the screen is for going back, but it seems like the left 10% at best and just to be safe I press on the very edge. I miss the buttons for turning pages.I also miss the 3G even though I didn't use it all that often. Now I just need to make sure I plan ahead on road trips.","Light is great, OK otherwise"
3,"So I love, love, love e-ink. I'm not even a big reader but t's this magic technology that no one seems excited about. There is literally ink inside the screen that moves up or down electronically. So it is literally an actual printed book page that can change in an instance.I like the Kindle Paperwhite and it does everything I need. But this particular version doesn't have the same pleasing page color as my 5 year old Kindle, which is strange. But I really needed the light to actually be able to read when I usually want to read. So when the light is on it's pretty nice.The interface is rather slow, which is to be expected given it's not a traditional LCD screen (it's literally a printing press), but I wish the interface had better ways to organize and change the order of books. The other problem I had was that the first one I received had a large hole in the upper layer of the screen (where the light diffuses through) so it had this glowing hole that reminded me of a giant stuck pixel. Also there were a few random stuck black spots. The next one did not have these problems. Amazon will replace it for you if it does.",I love e-ink. The Paperwhite isn't the greatest.
3,"I want to rate it 3.5 but best buy lets me rate it 3 or 4, nothing in between. Similarly I see no point in upgrading from an old paperwhite until you really want a 300 ppi display. Kindle Paperwhite is good but not much has changed over the years, if you plan to upgrade over the old one think if it is worth spending.A paperwhite with 3G goes up towards 180-200 USD, I would rather invest the money on a tab. If you are sticking with the base version as I brought (99 USD - no ads), then its a good deal.",Would like to give a 3.5 - got for 99$ with no ads
3,"I love reading so this e-reader works really well for me. I just wish it was a little bigger. I was used to another e-reader that had a larger screen. Otherwise, it works!",Good idea!
3,Little disappointed in. Item very hard to turn off but it is easier to read.,Ok
3,"I do not like the fact that every thing is in pictures instead of words. On my old paper white I had a list of unread books, now I have pictures. I don't read pictures. If there is a way to make it into a list, I have yet to find it. I thought the that reading is the point.",Not as good as the old one.
3,"The Paperwhite is certainly better than the regular Kindle, primarily due to the back lighting feature. If you buy a Kindle eReader, this would be the one to buy. You could spend more for the higher end models but there's really no need. The main issue with this eReader is the smudge effect at the bottom of the screen. I tried two Paperwhites and both had the same issue. Perhaps this is just how they are.",Decent eReader but has screen issues
3,This thing is ok. Next time we get electronics it will be Amason,I'm not shopping at Best Buy again
3,Have a nook as my first e-reader. I like downloading library books better on the kindle but prefer the format of the nook.,My first kindle. Second e-reader
3,I love it. Will definitely recommend it to a friend.,ok item
3,Not a bad product and for the price it makes a decent gift.,Ok for the price
3,I have a Paper White 1 and 2. Honestly it is difficult to justify double the price value. I certainly like most added features but not sure its worth the extra money. To note it operates great just not sure its worth an upgrade to the latest greatest.,Is it worth it
3,Was a Christmas gift and I ended up returning it because it wasn't exactly what I was looking for.,Nice product
3,It has what i wanted click to turn page and that is the only reason i paid that price for it. there is nothing special about it. i thhought that the battery would last longer and as an avid reader it doesn't last long enough.,NOT AS GREAT AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
3,Replaced a v1 nook but this is not better for reading,Not in love
3,My son truly loves his Kindle. He uses it everyday.,Great purchase
3,"I replaced my older Kindle Keyboard, which is larger and heavier than this kindle. Page turning takes some getting used to - I keep touching screen and turning page by mistake. You're able to turn the ""side buttons"" page turning off, but can't turn the touchscreen page turning off - it sure would be nice to allow page turns only with the ""side buttons"" - I think this is a major design flaw. Also, the audio option seems to be missing - you can't have books read aloud to you anymore. Also, no 3G. I almost returned this, but didn't get around to it, so I'm stuck with it.","Nice Light Weight & Size, but missing options"
3,Clear reading in bright light outdoor settings. Long battery life.,Easy to read in outdoor settings.
3,"The Kindle is great for just reading books, and the battery power is pretty good.The experimental browser is not very user friendly.",Experimental browser not great
3,It is the top of the line e reader by amazon which is also the leader in e readers. The voyage is an excellent device and very versatile to carry on your trips. I feel the premium for the page turn sensors is little too high. In hindsight I would go with the paper white and save a few bucks.,Great e reader but a bit over priced
3,Ive had the 1st kindle so it took time to get used to no keyboard but love the built in light that has auto adjusting. The homepage isnt as friendly,Hard to get used to-love the auto light
3,"turning pages not as easy as the original ones; whole Home Page experience not really user friendly, and seems geared to just sell you more books.",convenient size
3,Have had it for a while noe. A littlebit unusual to press so hard to change page but now starting to get used to it.,"Okay so far, nothing to mentioned bad or especiall"
3,doesnot work After three weeksI cannot open it. so sad,totally deied
3,I PURCHASED THIS ITEM BACK IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2017. I RETURNED THIS ITEM WITHIN 30 DAYS OF PURCHASE. I MAILED IT BACK PER INSTRUCTIONS BY AMAZON. TODAY MAY 26 I RECEIVED AN E-MAIL FROM AMAZON THAT THEY FAILED TO RECEIVE THE ITEM BY JUL. 20 SO THEY WILL CHARGE MY CREDIT CARD. I HAVE TO ASSUME THAT SOMEONE IN AMAZON RECEIVING DID NOT DO THEIR JOB LOGING IN THE ITEM OR US MAIL LOST THE ITEM. EITHER WAY I AM SCREWED.,I PURCHASED THIS ITEM BACK IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF ... One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No
3,Any one who doesn't want to spend too much money and get a tablet for kids it is perfect for them.,Good for kids
3,Good tablet althought the availability of apps thru their appstore is limited.,Decent tablet.
3,Bought this tablet for my 4 yo and 9 yo. Tablet was perfect for their use of watching movies and kid games,Great tablet for price point
3,"Works fine, don't like the ads. Easy to use speed ok.",On tablet
3,"It is ok to be a ""android"" tablet with such a low price. But the display is not good as they described.It hurts my eyes after long use.",Good Price but poor display
3,"Very basic. If you need more than the basics, look for an Android tablet.",Ok for Basics
3,good product but very hard to customize like real androids. Can not install firefox or other SW that Amazon deems a competition...too bad,Good
3,It's a cheap version to allow my wife to read books and such. No pretense that it's anything like an iPad but it's doing exactly what it should do for the price point it's set at.,Does what it's intended to do
3,"It has a delayed response. i can't access my email accounts unless I give Amazon access to control everything. I can't put my apps on my opening page. Amazon uses the Washington Post, I prefer the NYT. So far not a fan.",Controlled by Amazon
3,Could not download apps I needed to control my tvs,Great for beginner
3,"I bought this product for my three-year-old son. The operating system is slightly complicated unlike the user-friendly iPad. Fortunately, it serves it's purpose as there are many books, apps, and movies fingertips.",Not user-friendly but durable
3,The Kindle is better than the older version in the fact that I have used it a lot with game apps for the kids and it was bogged down with memory being used up but I held out on purchasing a new one the scores and in app purchases won't transfer to the new one so I got the new one and it works fast updates apps camera is not so good but all and all 3 stars,Needed a new kindle
3,"Amazon Fire is doing its job. Kids play games, access internet. Slower onside of streaming",Serving its purpose for cheap
3,I already had an iPad and just bought this to see what all the fuss was about. Haven't used it hardly ever.,Already had an iPad.
3,Didn't do all that I wanted it to but it is sufficient for my 8 year old son.,Good for the money
3,This tablet is great for minimal use for a child. It is slow so I wouldn't recommend it for an adult.,Great tablet for kids
3,So I got this for my nephew mostly for books for school and games but he tends to get anoid with it cause the internet connection that it picks up doesn't stay but other than that great,A little slow on connectivity
3,The usablity wise good but install the Google store is messy,Average
3,Bought another one because first one stopped working. Seems to match the cheap price. Made cheaply.,Replacement
3,"Lot of ads from amazon. Other than that, good for light use",Knew what I was buying
3,Got this as a gift for a friend. She had a little issue trying to set up at first but got it going eventually,Good Product
3,Considering this was under fifty dollars I am satisfied with it.,Works OK
3,It's amazing how much this inexpensive tablet can do. Slower than my iPad and I wish it had vudu but can't complain with a price tag under $50.,A great value
3,"i got this tablet for traveling. Just games, reading, stuff like that so I didn't need anything fancy. It works but it lags on games and the battery life is horrible.",It's ok
3,My 4 yo grandnephew and 3 yo daughter love them! The tablet does freeze but that's what happens sometimes! They love them!,Great for kids!!!
3,I am not too happy with the Kindle. It's ok but it seems to run slow and sometimes the sd card isn't reading. Would not purchase another,Kindle
3,Purchased this product for as a backup tablet. . The one con I have is that the internet browser runs a little slow. Other than that a good product.,Good tablet for children
3,It freezes up a lot but it's great for reading. Not meant for other apps.,It's alright
3,"this is a great pad device, big and good display. just you have to familiar with the amazon OS and they build it for E-book, so it will a little bit slow for even web site surfing.more serious in game playing.",Great pad device for the one have tight budget
3,As a starter tablet for a child this is great because it offers everything the more expensive tablets offer and it is very affordable. I wouldn't recommend this as a full service tablet because of it's speed,Not bad for the price
3,Bought this for my six-year old Daughter.Easy to navigate.The only knock is that is doesn't have expandable memory.,Not bad for the money.
3,Don't have much storage...ok for kids. Purchase tablet as a gift but didn't last long,Not much space
3,The only bad thing is it doesn't have google on it,Good tablet
3,My kids like down games and play with. It is for young children if you dont want spent a lot of money,Very good iteam for younk kids
3,"I had two of these in less than a year, it's definitely good for the price. The problem is that the charger port breaks very often. No matter how gentle toy are, it deteriorates within a couple months.",Not very durable
3,"Good price, functions well, nice screen to read books",Good for what it is
3,Got this on sale for 35 bucks I think. My I phone is faster and works better on most things but couldn't beat the price. Serve its purpose for occasional use and games.,Decent and excellent price
3,"Bought five of these for my teachers to take photos/videos and upload to our site and email parents. Does everything just fine, except the cameras aren't the greatest. Pretty slow to capture the pic and they all come out blurry with he slightest amount of motion (from the subject or photograher). Ok product if your not focused on taking pictures.",Not too bad...
3,Alexa doesn't know half of what my computer does. But the musical quality is good. It's a glorified radio. I think I would recommend the Dot. Save your money.,Echo
3,I stick with Google home for better value and sound quality,I am not a fan
3,The unit works good and understands you easily. Just not sure how much it can really do. The music quality is middle grade compared to other speakers.,Not sure-- works good but
3,Great sound for music. Use it for a reminder each day. Kind of a to do list. When I need time or temp just ask Alexa,Very unique
3,this was given as a gift and recipient happy with it.,useful product for home
3,"All in all it is pretty cool but seems pretty limited to me. Gets annoying when you constantly have to access SPotify before asking for an artist or it defaults to Amazon free previews...but I get it. Wish it could answer more questions but assume that will come with time, updates or future models. Feels like one of those technological offerings that you try and fit into your life versus one that naturally fills a void.",Novelty wears off quickly.
3,I WAS NEVER ABLE TO GET IT TO SEND PLAY MUSIC FROM MY IPHONE APP. IT WOULD ONLY PLAY SAMPLES OF MUSIC FROM AMAZON.,JUST WASN'T FOR ME
3,I originally purchased the Google Home and it was very nice but speaker was not loud enough and it was ugly on my night stand. I swapped to the Echo and it is nice looking at the illumination when responding. The bad part of this device is you have to be very specific when making request and the echo can't hear you when the volume is over 5/10. If I had to redo it I would probably keep the Google home. It was more accurate even on my wake up alarm.,Decent product but too expensive
3,Easy to setup but doesn't do everything without additional products. Better than google home.,Good for what it does
3,We have Google home and the Echo. We like Google Home better.,I like Google home better
3,"The white echo is nice-looking and subtle on the countertop. The sound quality is the best feature. Basic voice commands are best: is it raining?, other commands need effort: what are cumulus clouds? 'Sorry I don't know that'.",Convienent product
3,"I like the product, but I dislike that you have to download every app. I believe it should come with at least a few basic apps.",Great for people with children
3,Alexa- STEP UP YOUR GAME. Google home is coming for you. He coming!,Step up your game
3,"I liked the sound quality coming out of the Echo. I ended up returning this for an Echo Dot. The Dot is 1/3rd of the price and for my townhouse, I don't need a high powered speaker. Alexa is great to use, no matter what Echo device you have.","Great Sound, but Expensive"
3,"Ok, but sometimes alexa begin speaking without being asked, and sometimes light spins around when asked alexa a question without any answer.","Ok,"
3,"Unfortunately, Alexa is still complicated to get it to recognize smart devices.",Could be better
3,I get frustrated with this alot. I like being able to speak commands but she never seems to know much even though we add skills to her. She is always saying she doesnt know that. The speaker is not the quality that I would expect for the price.,Alexa
3,"I wasn't aware of all the apps that needed a premium membership for playing music. That was a disappointment, but other than that I enjoy the product.",Alexa
3,I feel like it plays the same playlist every time.,Limited options
3,The sound coming from the echo is amazing considering it's small size.,Good sound
3,"It's a great product to have , loud speaker , however if you don't have any accessories to go with it don't buy it but if you have the money buy it",Great comedian
3,Lots of stuff available to add to enhance performance.,Great for a beginner
3,It works great with my Hue and also requesting music. But deeper questions it doesn't know much,Does not know much
3,"The music was good, however, Alexa's voice was inaudible most of the time. It couldn't meet our needs so we returned it.",Music for listening pleasure was good.
3,Took awhile to get it all setup. After getting it all setup it was fun to play with for awhile than it was just okay. Have to get the wording just right to listen to radio stations or it tells you can't find it or plays something totally different.,Fun little gadget
3,"Alexa works great for listening to spotifly (only if you have premium) and very basic information (time, weather). She has a tough time answering questions. This is not a Google machine. She consistently would not understand simple questions. The volume is very loud and can be adjusted manually or through voice. She also can learn skills which some are hit and miss. I'd still recommend this product if you have a smart home (smart outlets, locks) or if you have spotifly premium.",Amazing for music but terrible for information.
3,I love my device but wish there was more of a descriptive summary of how to get music stations and as well as other features. I've learned most by just coming upon things. Needs better operating instructions,Complicating
3,Returned item because my phone did everything Alexa does. The best thing was the quality of the speaker.,Returned
3,Received this as a gift. I don't use it much but family loves it.,Cool unit
3,"acts up a lot , but has a lot of good features. but then again i should go over the instructions.",works ok
3,"The Echo is ok, it's a decent speaker and I like that it has a Bluetooth so I can listen to music off my phone.But there is more that I don't like then I like.For example, to play music off spottily you must have a perineum account ($10 a month).I heart radio will play only the last station it had on, not sure yet but can't change station with just voice.Most of ""skills"" are done poorly, for example my Honeywell thermostat, you can't ask it to tell you the temp, turn on, turn off.Only thing that can be done, is to ask it to raise or drop the temperature.At this time it will not control my wifi sprinkler system ""orbit Bhyve"".You don't always get an answer to questions as it uses Bing as a search engine, which I'm not a big fan of .Tried to buy wifi light switches so I can have it controlling that, but after purchasing the Wemo switch I found out that all the switches in my house are 2 way switches, so that did not work.So basically it's just ok, and maybe in few years it will be better, but over all like I said there is more that I don't like about it.",Decent
3,We have an echo dot in my son's room and bought this for the kitchen. I'm not sure why this is so much more but has the same functionality. I wish we would have bought another dot instead!,Not sure why this over dot
3,Echo was easy to set up. Speaker is not as good as the Google Home. Both the Nest thermostat and the Inseon hub seem to be working okay with the Echo.3 stars because I have not used all the functions yet.,Functionality
3,Good for playing music on a limited basis.Requires Spotify premium to play many selections. Frustrating when it only plays small samples of some artists.,Not as good as expected
3,"Giving it an average rating because boo hoo, I haven't figured out how to make it work yet. It responds but doesn't seem to have answers to any of my queries or requests. It must be just a matter of connecting it to a proper wireless source. So far I haven't figured it out. I am eager to however! I guess I am just too technologically challenged.",Haven't figured it out yet
3,The Amazon Echo is a great item. Sometimes the echo doesn't respond to the commands or cannot answer,Great first generation electronic
3,not as smart as the commercials show. cant answer a lot of questions,nice product
3,"It's going to take more work to get her up to useful capacity, but she has a nice speaker for music in the kitchen.","Alexa, my average intelligent friend."
3,"I bought this as a gift for my son and his wife. I rhougjt with having a young baby at home and their hands always full it would come in handy. They liked the idea but after doing their own review search, decided it wasn't for them.",Bought as gift
3,"I have a dot as well as this one. There is never a problem with the dot being able to hear me, but the Echo is like an obstinate child. There is still time to return it so I'll give it a few more days to behave. If not, it goes back.",It goes deaf after awhile
3,The family loves this because they can communicate to this device and ask it to play their favorite songs or questions or just about anything you can Google.. Even jokes!,Family loves it!
3,it does a lot LESS than you would expect. the advertisements is about all it does. no need to spend this large amount of money to listen to music you have on your phone. any info you get on the echo you get on your phone.,ok device
3,"Cool device but not totally useful as internet tool completely...but do use it for several helpful tasks, music, alarms and weather updates",Cool item
3,"Thought I'd be enjoying this more. Clever interface when Alexa gets it right, more frustrating than it should be when she gets you wrong!",Ok
3,"I haven't really used mine that much, therefore I cannot rate it to its fullest. So far its been good.",Good overall buy
3,I thing is cool too can listen to radio get news from CNN FOX but if you don't have Amazon Prime it is dumb as a brick.,works better with prime
3,Like this but doesn't always get the commands correct. Doesn't answer questions the way the Google version does.,Like it
3,"I should have waited until this was more advanced, it keeps disconnecting from the wifi and it's a pain to reboot it, doesn't know much either, we have only had it 3 weeks so we will see how it grows with us",great for out of the gate
3,"so far it's a nice toy in the kitchen, and it appears that there is a lot of up and coming apps that will be nice once they are all working. right now it can only do basic stuff. the speaker on it is just ok, they could improve that on the next upgrade. i don't even think it's stereo.",up and coming
3,"The echo is certainly able to answer many questions but it is inferior to the Google Home. We bought both and use them side by side and the Home is able to retrieve answers or information that the Echo is not on a somewhat frequent basis. Examples are questions or requests such as ""how many calories are in a pop-tart"", searching for certain songs or types of music, and calculating time and distance between two cities by car. The Home was able to do all of these things while the Echo was not. The home also tends to provide information beyond the direct answer to your question while the Echo does not. The Echo definitely has superior sound quality but I'm not sure it's worth it.",Useful but needs improvement
3,It works as advertised. I bought it as a gift so don't use it everyday.,It listens
3,Did not work is good as I thought it would switch to Google home much better product,Amazon Echo
3,"The whole AI question and answer dynamic is cool, but the speakers are weak. The bass is non existent and the treble is harsh.",Alexa is cool but...
3,I returned the item because itt was not wireless. It always needed to be plugged in in order to work. Otherwise it was a great product. I was looking for something that could be taken from level to level as well as outside with ease.,The sound was great
3,Great concept and easy for kids to use but it does take a lot of set up in many different areas to work like you want it to. You can't just plug it in and go.,Good concept and easy for kids to use
3,"Love talking to Alexa to tell it to control temp, what to play , what to mix",Love Echo/Alexa
3,"Echo is tough to deal with. Doesn't understand most the questions I ask. You definitely can't do a follow up question. Speaker sounds great. Looks great. Also will hook up to devices for automation. Hopefully they update it for comms, cuz google home is killing it there.",Not Smooth
3,"The product works fine, but you need to install a bunch of apps to use to its full potential.",Not for a beginner
3,Data is tied to skills and should just be a blanket open forum of knowledge. Still has other benefits to explore.,Needs more fluent data knowledge
3,"On my opinion I bought very-very good toy for the people who loves play with technology of the future.. I'm really enjoy when I demonstrate it to my friends and they are impressed. But unfortunately it is not useful for most of the standard users. As I said in a most cases it's just a ""GOOD TOY""...",Very Good Toy
3,After a week of using the Amazon echo I found myself using it less and less each day. I tried several times for it to do commands no luck. Save your money.,Okay
3,I'm still learning this I will submit another review once I use this more,Echo
3,Good product..Makes life easy.I have no issues so far with this .,Na
3,I could have done without it. You need to install a whole bunch of apps to have a competent Alexa. I guess Echo would work better with a Smarthome. Sometimes it has a hard time with my accent.,I thought it was better...
3,"All the static about this item, not sure why. I did get a better deal buying two. Cant wait to gift it to someone. it appears a lot of my questions go unanswered.",OK
3,"I know a lot of the ability of the Amazon Echo is more than I know...if there was a real tutorial available, this would probably be a great product.",Alexa is knowledgeable...but not too bright.
3,"Not what I was thinking, most questions asked, I get response. Hmm",It's ok
3,"I have wanted my Amazon Echo for several years and was able to buy one BUT not without an extended warranty! Which if you buy ANY ANY thing from BEST BUY, it's Now imperative you spend your money for an extended warranty! Like now if it wasn't for the warranty on my Moto phone that I HAD to return it! Which is totally dysfunctional NOW and friends can't get it to work! My new exchanged phone has t totally screwed up my availability to access Pandora! Luckily, there's an extended warranty you have no choice BUT to purchase! They ""TRY"" to make everything right with customers!",Okay if you have access to Pandora
3,"I just brought 4 and NO I has had success pairing the device. Amazon doesn't have any tech assistance and the directions are for a remote but w-o a smart TV, I don't think you can get much from the device.",Alexa is easy but it has issues
3,"Alexa is a great tool. It's fun to use, but the DOT has just as much functionality and seems to hear my voice better. The speaker on the Echo is better, but when the volume us up high, it can't hear me at all. The DOT can connect to an external speaker via bluetooth or 3.5mm, and it's a third of the price",Get the DOT
3,The dot does everything this does and most people already have blue tooth speakers to hook up to it.,Get the dot
3,"Sound quality is pretty good if you want it to play background music, but I still prefer Sonos for this purpose. Alexa is useful for controlling the widest range of smart home products, but it's not backed by Google Home's superior search intelligence, so it isn't that great for asking in-depth questions of it. There are comparisons of these products out there, so take a look before making a decision. Since I mostly wanted it for home control, it suits my need.","Decent speaker, but Alexa is mediocre"
3,Alexa is nice but it lacks a lot of informayion when asking questions. It's not like your smart phone that you can ask anything and will give you the answer. Only to certain thing and you have to email el certain apps in the Alexa app itself to work. Still working on Alexa so maybe that could be the reason but I though it would be like Siri that you can ask anything.,Great but need work
3,"Summary says it all really. It works, but its not really very useful.",Just a gimmick to sell music services
3,Had trouble setting it up. Set it up using app on wife's phone. It doesn't work when wife's phone is out of the house. Grandkids have fun with it. Music speakers are good. I have a lot to learn about this thing.,Haven't Figured Everything Out
3,"Love the product, not happy that there have been two sales on it at Best Buy. One 18 days after purchase $50 off, today 23 days after purchase online $80 off. They won't help me, after 15 days I was told!",I like my Amazon Alexa a lot
3,I thought Alexa was like your smart phone Siri but it's not. It's very limited to what you can ask and you must download some of the Apps in within the Alexa app to work and ask question. Not what I though it was.,Needs work
3,The amazon echo does what it's supposed to do. I wish it could call 911.,Good
3,"Fun to use but not fun with the software. I tried forever to get it to recognize my light modules to turn the lamps on and off. I gave up. If they ever fix the software it would be great. Other than that, it is nice to ask Alexa things and play music. Speaker is good. Amazon Echo software needs a lot of improvement.",Good Unit!
3,I was disappointed that she can't connect to you tube. She's otherwise great. You have to be very specific when asking her something. When I ask about news in a certain region. She just gives the general news which may have nothing about the specified region.,Like her
3,"Without the lights, thermostat or alarm that you would attach to the echo doesn't seem like a practical thing. If you plan on having the other items to connect then it would probably be a better device for you. Again, solid device I just don't have use for it daily.",It doesn't fit my needs.
3,I didn't know much about the device before buying other than the fun commercials. I figured that it was internet connected and could do anything I asked it to. I quickly learned this is not the case. You aren't able to just plug it in and expect it to know everything on the internet. It seemed it didn't know know some basic questions. It uses skills where are like phone APs. You have to enable each skill in order to use it. When you want to use a skill much like an ap you have to remember the specific skill and then Include that in what you ask it to do. It seems like it does home automation well and basic functions but it has a long way to go before it's a know everything on the internet,Fun toy
3,"I ordered the echo based upon online reviews and based on suggestions of friends. However, thus far, the only thing I ever use it for is to play music, which I could easily do with my other electronics. I am holding out hope that future updates make this more of a must have item.",Lots of hype
3,Doesn't do much except radio and a couple of games. Wait for future skills before buying,Expensive radio remote
3,"Great for Music and games. Bluetooth/wifi connections. Alexa asked me to have a conversation. I kept it simple and try to teach it. its favorite response is ""I do not know that one"" I give it answers and next time I ask the same question it responds I do not know that one. Dumb as a rock. For radio play back and music sound the Alexa beats all. On sale 89.99 I would recommend to a friend. Would not recommend at the $179.99 price.",Sound beats all.
3,"So I've seen this at the mall and the TV ads and thought hmmm that sounds good. Note mine does not sound as good as the units I've heard play music at the stores. I don't know why and there does not seem to be any adjustments you can make to that. All you can do is say volume up, volume down or say volume lever 1-10.At no time was I told that you needed to use your smart phone and or table to down load the Alexa App and then run everything through that. Most of the time I say Alexa who is Morris Knight. ""I don't know"" Alexa was Morris Knight a VJ on MTV. ""I don't know"". Alexa can you tell me who was a VJ on MTV ""I don't know"". So I get ""I don't know"" more often then an get and answer. If I do get an answer Alexa will often give me an answer to a for a different person the person I asked about.If you have a Amazon Fire Stick. Don't ask Alexa about a ""MOVIE"" or is Joan Collins in the movie The Virgin Queen. Because for me anytime I use the word ""MOVIE"" she will turn on my Fire Stick. So if you are watching something else you are no longer watching it. She can turn on the Amazon Fire Stick but she can't put your TV back to what you were watching before.The Echo device will often tell you to go to the Alexa App. So I'm really not sure what the Echo Device does. Everything is run through the Alexa App so just get your table out and use Alexa that way?I'm just not very happy with this purchase. I went to the Mall and the person said ""Bring in your Tablet and I can see what is going on"". So see it's driven by that tablet and the app right?",You need a Tablet or Smart Phone to have this work
3,"This new technology does what it's intended to do. My kids love it. They talk to Alexa every day, listen to music and even ask homework questions.",Good product
3,"The idea is right but after few weeks, needs restarting else it doesn't respond properly. Compatible devices pairs properly. I used lifx bulbs but it couldn't control them with voice says no device found. Hopefully they will release a software update soon.",OK OK product
3,I wish alexa was a little smarter. Sometimes she doesn't understand what i am trying to ask.,ALEXA
3,To much programming especially for road and traffic congitions,Great for the tec nieve but to much programming
3,"I love it, but the first one I bought didn't work. When I got a working model I was very happy. Super cool technology",Great when it works
3,"Since I am more of an Apple Buckie, I wish this had more integration to my iTunes Library. I use it with my LifeX lights, get the news and weather. Not sure I would buy it again, but if you are a Google Buckie then it would be a great toy",Nice Toy
3,Just wish it would learn faster. Seems like the Google home has better knowledge with Internet info.,Happy for the most part.
3,I find Alexa to be extremely useless at times. It's a chore trying to search for specific music through Amazon's music list (this is trying to find common songs played on the radio currently),AI is not very accurate.
3,the app for that does not work well i haven't used it that much just for news,its ok
3,"It seems that the majority of questions I have, Alexa does not have a clue.",Could be smarter
3,"Had this, have the dot, have two Google homes. I prefer Google home. You can YouTube rhere differences. Alexa is okay but nothing extraordinary. I use it to turn on lights, and that's about it.",Think about it.
3,Best Buy employees could have been more knowledgeable on this item,Great product
3,"Maybe I didn't give it enough time. I had it a few weeks before I returned it. I just didn't feel the love. I see a lot of potential. I was wanting to control some of my WIFI connected devices like my thermostat, TV, and some lighting. but it took a lot of programming to get it there. So maybe after they do the heavy programming for outside devices then I'll try it again.",Not my thing... YET
3,"OK, I bought this with high expectations after watching the commercials. I thought it's going to be better than Siri, but no. It can react or answer some of your calls very well, but it's very limited. Now I use it to play prime musics only.",Not impressed at all
3,"After all the great reviews I thought it would be wonderful to use as a helping hand running a business solo. However, for this case it isn't very helpful. Unlike Cortana or Siri, Alexa only works with commands based on the petty apps that can generate the commands. It can't use your whole phone or computer to pull up apps or anything special. Even the simple stuff like weather was a hassle to try to change location and simple data like calendar, and anything you want to learn just refers back to the Alexa app which by the way is absolutely awful. You can't use your own calendar alone, everything has to be linked to one of the several lackluster apps that have been created. I think this will be great in the future but as far as offices go, it seems an unnecessary false luxury. At home with smart appliances may be its only use. (Recommended for home entertainment use only).",Decent but lacking
3,"When companies play nice with each other... the customers win. This product is fairly novel if you aren't completely bought in to the Amazon ecosystem. I would use it way more if they played nice with Apple services. I know it's a competitor, but if both companies goals are to build an awesome product for a customer, they should play nice.",Awesome product as a standalone...
3,"Although this got great reviews, I am still trying to figure it out. When it doesn't understand my question I rephrase it and sometimes even then Alexa still can't answer. I have been reading about how to get the most out of Alexa but I'm actually still on the fence about whether or not I will keep it. Am I missing something? What is it that others see that I don't?",Trying To Figure It Out
3,The echo is so much fun to play with and works great with Amazon and hue products. It's very hard to get it to work with our iPhone and iTunes. I can't figure out how to get my iTunes playlist to work or sync it to my calander from phone. I'm sure it's possible because my tech skills are mediocre at best. Had I known what a pain this would be I would have looked into the google product more closely. The echo itself is a great product but I would not buy it again unless they open it up to other providers services.,Doesn't play well with apple products
3,This is a good starter. As the company provides more devices that it can control it will become excellent. It's very limited at this time.,Great Technology
3,"I'm constantly getting updates on how they are making the echo great. It will take time, but needs to also integrate with phone to send and receive calls and text messages. Hate having to tell it what 3rd part app to integrate with also. Good for smarthome features.","Great start, will be better with enhancements"
3,Thought the Echo was portable. Have to keep it plugged it to operate or buy an external battery.Returned and bought the smaller TAP which has a builtin battery.,Nice but not portable
3,"The Echo is a great product if you have money to burn and tech savvy. Alexa (echo) learns as you talk to it and ask questions. You have to go online and enable different skill sets to allow Alexa to answer more questions. As for operating smart devices this cannot happen wirhout a huge expense. You have to purchase wifi/smart bulbs and switches before she can operate. One smart switch or wifi bulb can cist as much as $30. That's pretty steep to me. On occasion, Alexa will begin talking when no one has called her to respond.",Good product for tech savvy folks
3,"Wondering why I spent $150 for the Echo when I could have purchased the Dot for $40 and does everything the Echo does...and more! With the Dot you can stream music to Bluetooth speakers, which can't be done with the Echo.","Good, but could be better."
3,I am looking forward to getting to know this product better. it is not as plug and play as I thought,not such a great ease of use
3,Glad it was half-price. Alexa doesn't know much compared to siri.,get a siri
3,Very limited. Have activate skills.. a little bit of a pain. Otherwise fun to mess with her. Will learn as we go. Have used go control lights and other. Works ok.,It's ok
3,"I initially liked the product, the work it does and with the speakers. But then with time you feel bored, in specific if you are listener of hindi music as the songs are repetitive. Amazon Unlimited Music does not holds a very good library of Hindi Music. Secondly, Alexa is probably tuned to answer more of ""I don't know"". After purchasing, I realized and read more reviews that Google Home provides much better answers to queries put against it and has a wide range of hindi music.",Acceptable but soon you start feeling bored
3,"I was expecting something more intuitive, moving to google..",Not great....
3,Alexa is a great device. The only drawback is not being able to simultaneously stream all devices throughout the house. Hopefully Amazon is working on a solution,Awesome
3,I Ive used this for a month now. It works great 75 percent of the time. Alexa doesnt always understand you. The mic doesnt hear you when your 20 feet away.,Works great
3,My Alexa doesn't recognize Agoura hills. Does not play free music. How can I get those to work,Need extra purchase to work well
3,I am unable to connect with iPad Pro which limits one of the primary reasons for the purchase. I will appreciated recommendations to connect the devices.,A little disappointed.
3,I am sure Alexa does many things but so far she hasn't reached her full potential! User needs to learn to implement her skills!,Need to learn potential
3,Alexa functions until yopu attempt to connect to multiple devices. Then technical suppprt is WORTHLESS!,"Unable to get reliable, understandable technical"
3,"Nothing special. It is a pretty good speaker for the money, but it's not that useful for much else. My Apple TV does more for home automation and entertainment.",Not that useful but a pretty good speaker
3,Worked great the first week then started to reset randomly finally had to hard reset it works fine now maybe had an update I use it for my morning alarm and play music at night,Has bugs
3,Took product back and was told that in order to get assistance the Geek squad would have to help me at my home and be charged for the service. I decided we didn't need the product that badly so took it back for a refund.,Couldn't get it to cync with wifi
3,More intelligent than siri however speaker performance is lacking when used for music. Sonos play1 or bose soundlink has much better sound.,Fun at first but...
3,Absolutely love my Alexa but I am still figuring it out. I purchased it majority for listening to music & I love that. I ask questions & her response is I'm not sure or I don't know sounds yet. I know she can do more but I'm lost right now.,Still figuring it out
3,"If you aren't tech savvy, know someone who is to be able to get Alexa to respond. Amazon was kind enough to email me to offer support; I'm afraid the first question will be, ""Is it plugged in?"" I'm not tech savvy, but I also have some sense.",Difficult
3,"Not what I expected, I am not satisfied with the product",Expectations
3,It is a pretty cool device. Not too friendly for the music I already had to get it to play them. My main use was to operate my ADT Pulse security system. It acts as a third party app and the question gets too lengthy and does not always find the device I wanted the first time. I took it back. Maybe the newer version coming out will work better.,Flip flop on liking it
3,Amazon account dependent speaker with decent sound,Decent sound
3,"Fun for the first few days, but we hardly use it now after figuring out it can't answer many of our queries.",A novelty that can't do everything
3,"Alexa is entertaining for music, questions etc. I was hoping for something more advanced, like being able to reminder for an appointment 15min before the appt. is schedule. You can set a reminder for 15 minutes....but only from the time you ask alexa...good for cooking but not much else","Good for getting basic information, playing music"
3,"It's the thing to have, to go along with the crowd, but it ends up being very much underutilized. I'm sure it's capable of more than making a shopping list and doing a flash briefing. But we don't have the time to learn. Other than that, it works just fine.","It's the thing to have, to go along with the crowd"
3,Does not do as much as expected. Has a hard time finding information. Has to have extra things to work well I.e. Monthly fee,Not What Expected
3,Not easy to setup. Everything is apps which you must memorize the directions. Need to take a course to use. Not user friendly.,High learning curve
3,Product works ok. It's user friendly. I don't really need or use it much after purchasing it. For those that like it ..what a bargain,Good Value
3,Many great features but the speaker does not meet expectations. I also have a google home. I ended up putting the google home in the living room because the sound was Better and put the Echo in the bedroom. I would also think it would be nice to have a plug to attach a speaker. You can use blue tooth but if your going to use a dedicated speaker to improve sound it would be nice to have the option.,Speaker quality for music sub-par
3,"little more complicated than i thought ,had to buy a harmony remote for tv to do what i wanted it to do.commands must be very specific",fun and neat
3,There are some privacy concerns as recently reported in the news and the device is limited without a paid subscription to Amazon Music.,Not too useful
3,Alexa did not powerful as Siri of Apple. It can not play YouTube. It is very limit to play music. It is required to open some accounts to play music.,Just okay
3,"Very limited in capabilities. I am used to using ""OK Google"" on my phone.... Alexa is nowhere near as helpful or intuitive. It's more like Siri Wish it were easier to put iTunes purchases in the Amazon library for Alexa to play. That said, I knew what I was getting. Hoping the technology improved within a couple years.",OK. Not great.
3,a lot of the times Alexa will come back and say I don't understand the question get very annoying,its ok
3,"Most of the things you ask it, it doesn't know the answer to",It's ok
3,"I have not been able to get alexa to answer most questions and it is difficult to figure out how to delete your prior questions.... I think it is more of a novelty and good for playing music, but if you think you will be getting great info, your online web search is far better, this is very basic.",not exactly what is portrayed
3,I would say about 50% of the questions you ask are answered - far too much I do not know. You do not get that same level when yopu google something so not sure why the difference. I would hope there would be further upgrades you can download.,Not that bright
3,Alexa is great and performs well. Biggest issues are Bing is a horrible search engine and is inevitably wrong vs Google. Many times it doesn't understand the question or gives wrong answers while OK google gives much better repossess. Also Amazon music is somewhat limited. Should allow ability to play Sonos or iTunes libraries.,Good but Bing is horrible
3,It's nice but there are too many specific lines to remember to get her to talk to you. Also your family gmail calendar does NOT connect if on iCloud with iPhones so she will not know your families calendar. Needs updates and she should be able to answer you by a question and not a specific way you must say things with the skills,Like it but don't live it
3,It would be nice if there were more interaction with Home Entertainment Deivices. Only purchased because works with Harmony Remote.,OK Device
3,Should come capable of doing more out of the box!!,Should come capable of doing more out of the box
3,Works and recognized a lot of commands but doesn't work when the music is high.,Good product but has its fails
3,"It is a neat gadget; can do some things like track items for a shopping list and setting timers that are great. I would have expected it to be better at telling me things like when is TV show X on and what sound does a Cardinal (bird) make. All were met with ""I didn't understand the question."" Alexa should be more intuitive than that and should learn and grow as you go along, she does not. You also have to ask things in a way Alexa will understand. For example, you cannot say, ""Alexa, turn out the lights in the kitchen."" That ""does not compute."" But if you say, ""Alexa, shut off the lights."" She will do as you ask. I had to start writing down the ""correct"" way to ask her things so I would remember them. Again she needs to learn and adapt; not happening so far.",Not as Intuitive as Expected
3,"It is a great idea needs some improvement,lots of questions asked,its reply is I don't or can't answer that.",It's ok plays music
3,"I enjoy the Alexa for music using Pandora. Unfortunately, I can not listen to music that is on my iPhone. I've done all the things that it told me to do to download music to the Alexa app but it still does not recognize the songs. Also, it seems that the Alexa only uses Bing for looking up information from the internet and not google. So, she's very limited in providing information when asked a question. Maybe, it's not that compatible with apple products and best used with families who have windows based products.",Convenient for music
3,"Got both Echo and Dot. About 5 times a day I loose connectivity. Worked with tech support 3 times. Now, they suggest I have to adjust Motorola router settings to make the router compatible. More time!.",Beware - Router Re-program a Possibility
3,It's ok but not sure it's worth it chance of misorder,Ok
3,I do like some things about this but I still believe it cost to much,Ok
3,Received Echo as a Bday present. Returned and purchase the Dot.Saved about $150. Love the Dot.,Echo vs Dot
3,"Echo is Ok, but I am just not seeing the product value provided for the cost. Many times Alexa doesn't understand what we are saying and is extremely frustrating to my wife and child. Speaker sound is good quality, but not at all impressed with the AI capabilities.","Echo is OK, but I don't see the Cost to Value"
3,Just ask or command the machine does it...getting really lazy now LOL,fun
3,I probably have to learn more ways to use it but right now it is just okay. Does not seem to know answers to many questions asked. I guess I expected more from ti,It is less than expected
3,I had a chance to see the Google Home in action before I purchased this and now wished I had picked the Google Home. I have yet to have Echo answer a question for me without saying she cannot answer the question.,Okay device
3,"News, weather and music. That is pretty much all we use it for. If you have Amazon Prime it's nice to just request certain music to play. Sound is ok, not terrible, not great.",echo
3,"Serves it's purpose. Pretty neat features, I like it.",Pretty cool
3,"Love voice controlling my lites and small appliances, but there are some bugs to work out, sometimes have to ask twice, sometimes does not recognise them, but I am patient, uses Bing as a search, not impressed,",Good but cautious
3,"I was very interested in the Echo and respective echo dot based on potential functionality. While there are some good qualities, the overall voice automation and functionality haven't lived up to the hype yet. Pros: sound quality for music is fantastic, kids enjoy asking Alexa questions, overall family fun. Cons: even after a full month of learning my voice, Alexa continues to frequently answer ""I don't know what you are asking"", at random times, Alexa will start talking without any prompt, setting up additional controllable items and syncing are not as easy as Amazon would have you believe, and worst experience....every time an amazon echo commercial comes on tv to promote the product, my Alexa replies to the TV commercial as if it were me saying ""Alexa....""",Not quite what I was expecting
3,Amazon Prime was required in order for us to use the Echo the way we wanted,"Some free systems, but needed to purchase more"
3,I was excited about purchasing the Amazon echo but when I received it after about 2 weeks I had to return it because a lot of times Alexa did not hear me or understand what I asked.,okay product
3,The best thing about the echo is the sound quality. Too many times Alexa doesn't have the answer to your question. Too many skills required to make Alexa useful. I like to use it as a radio. Will play most radio stations across the country.,Needs work
3,"Sometimes you have to be very specific on where to find the information. For example, if Alexa does not know the answer, I have to tell her to look in Wikimedia",Entertaining
3,"Family of 5 and now 6 with Alexa. Seriously she adds another element to our family entertainment and smart home utility. Kids play games with her, like 20 ?s, jeopardy, riddles, jokes, and daily Easter eggs. While the adults like smart concerts, sports highlights, news briefs and all the things your ""Siri"" can do, by more. Like turn on/off your lights, coffee maker, tv, and whatever else you hook your smart outlets to.(sold separately) Now for the ""Alexa bugs."" More often than not, we find ourselves repeating commands. Attempted fix, by using voice training multiple times in areas we are most when aroud Alexa. Saw minor improvement. We also wish the command to increase or lower volume was more efficient. Shouting ""Alexa, volume 5 multiple times after a song you liked was at volume 7 or higher is annoying. We've learned to manually adjust her volume at the base which we can do with our old stereo? I was curious how Alexa would respond to 5 different voice patterns. Surprisingly , once she hears her name and the command prompt, she responds correctly 89% of the time.My wife tells me I'm cheating on ""Siri"" and ""Cortana"" as ""Alexa"" has quickly won my heart and my kids as well. We're glad we went with this, not the dot or google home. If you plan on making voice purchases as commercials advertise, careful- your kids might order 50lbs of cookie dough as Alexa doesn't recognize who's voice is ordering it. Overall, the gimmicks wear off, but we routinely enjoy smart concerts and our smart light system. soon we will be asking these robots to do our dishes, laundry, cook, or whatever else humans don't feel like doing. Hopefully I see this unfold in my lifetime- Brunsch","Great, but some quirks n kinks"
3,Has good sound but when it comes to answering commands it seems to be a little on the ignorant side,Fella little short
3,"It's technically sound, but not extremely useful. Perhaps future updates will make it more useful.",More of a toy than a tool
3,Need to explain all required' hookups' to less non technical elderly people for sure.,Technology luxury
3,Love being able to just ask it to do things however there is a learning curve. You have to also kind of teach it what you want.,Love hate
3,You have to purchase to many accessories for it to work.,Great Idea!
3,"I have to say Alexa has been a great disappointment. Most of the time she doesn't know the answer to anything and tells us that she doesn't understand the question. I thought this thing was supposed to get smarter as it goes along. We had to sign up for AMAZON Prime and Unlimited Music just to actually listen to decent music. When she does know a command for example like say ""Loop Mode"" when you want her to repeat a song... most of the time she understands that. And then there are a lot of times when she simply beeps out or even says she doesn't understand the question no matter how many times you say it. We use her mostly for a timer, alarm, play music and for 6 questions of Jeopardy a day. Really needs a lot of improvement. Ask her what a dog says.. she says bow wow or woof. *Sigh* If she can only be basic on that answer, there isn't much more she is gonna get right. There are also a lot of pretty useless skills for her available. We got it at a discounted price thankfully and I also got a Dot for in the bedroom at a cheaper price. Dot is even worse at listening to commands than Echo is.",Not all I thought it would be
3,"We like the convenience that the echo offers but it seems to fall down on some things. For example, store hours are often not available when asked. Wondering if the Google Home wasn't the way to go.",Not sure
3,"I was somewhat disappointed to discover Alexa could not seem to answer what I thought were fairly simple questions (mileage distance between locations, etc.). Additionally, I was not comfortable upon discovering the product constantly recorded conversations.",Did Not Meet Expectations
3,Not as comprehensive as I thought.Basic questions avaid her perview.I hope there will be some software upgrades soon.,Not what I expected
3,"This product is fun, but it does not understand a lot of your questions. It is not a user friend item. So it is limited to very few things it can do. For the money, it needs a lot of work. I was expecting more. But it is a toy to have.","I do like it, But needs work"
3,"Not bad,but returned it and bought a dot to go with my soundtouch 20. Would recommend this if your not fussy about your music.",Not bad
3,Until I buy all the lights and linked products this is just a radio with limited stations.,By itself boring
3,There are a lot of questions that were not answered. I just like the fact that I don't have to get up and turn off the lights.,Works well
3,"bought this to see the difference from google's product. was not happy, google was more responsive and easier to use. returned product 2 days later!",amazon echo
3,It takes practice and getting familiar with it. It is fun.,More apps more use
3,"This item is ok,haven't really used it to the full extent need to learn more and figure out what other benefits it has to offer.",Alexa does what
3,"Traded in the Echo for Google Home after trying both. Did the training questions but still found it could only answer 6 of 10 questions. There were many specific apps but trying to remember the cues words is more difficult. Google home answers without cue words the first time and can extend a conversation based on the first question. Can ask for driving times to destinations without an app, same for getting a cocktail recipe. Very dry responses where GH has personality. Try them both before deciding what is best for your needs.",Google Home Much Better Daily
3,"The Echo is good, but doesn't know the answer to what I consider, some basic questions. i.e. 3 top scoring players in the NBA. I suppose as it updates info, more information will become available.",Fun product
3,First got it for my wife who loves tech toys. We played with it and laughed and laughed. But after awhile it's used less and less as it can't find answers to things.,Was fun for awhile
3,"If you enjoy music do not buy, you cannot send a Bluetooth signal out to an external speaker. She is not as smart as Siri and answers basic basic questions. I deal with it because I bought the WeMo fixtures for lights and switches and she works fine with those. I would recommend the echo dot if you would like to make her louder or like music loud",Great for only certain things
3,Cant answer as well as Amazon wish i had waited and bought Amazon,Unimpressed
3,The eco is great if your a lists person or want to order Pizza. Yes it can control lights and locks but it doesn't support my remote lights I have now. The Eco just can't answer technical home work questions like the Google can,I think i should bought the Google Home
3,Does not have answers for a lot of questions. But is fun to have,Nice Bluetooth gadget
3,"This product is great for reading you the news, a book or the weather. Alexa is great at setting timers and alarms and telling silly jokes. If you ask Alexa a ""google"" type question such as ""What was the score to 'such and such' college basketball game"", most times she cannot answer even if you pose the question a number of ways. Sometimes, you can ask a question differently from the way you would intuitively ask a question and Alexa will answer. This proves frustrating to me. It is a very expensive gadget that your phone can easily do with a few keystrokes. I am considering returning it and purchasing the google product to see if there is an improvement.","Doesn't answer ""Google"" type questions"
3,"The Echo is not very good at answering questions. It is good at playing music and telling you the weather. I'm sure it will get better, but it is more of an annoyance with a toddler in the house. It does tell cute jokes, but it says ""I'm sorry I can't find that answer"" more often than not. The sound is quite good from this model, and works well with Spotify.",Best for music
3,Mostly good for shopping lists and listening to music getting game scores etc. Hopefully will have real search functions in the future. Easy setup. Phone app,Good for shopping lists
3,Alexa is handy but doesn't always work. We have two lights outside and sometimes both with turn on or off when commanded and sometimes only one will turn on or off.,Doesn't always work
3,"She is like my personal assistant, but I wish she is as smart as Siri... but since there is no one else like her, she will do for now.",Nice product
3,"I was excited to purchase the Amazon Echo, but when I thought that I could carry it out on the beach I was a little disappointed. If it had the capabilities to have a battery life to use without being plugged up it would be excellent.",Wasn't exactly what I expected
3,Very easy to setup up and can be used to automate home using smart skills. I use to control hue lighting and nest products. Only complaint is she is not as smart as they say. Constant updates are making her better but lacking a lot of information when asked. Emails are sent with update info. 90 percent on voice commands. Wish it came with optional remote for when you are out of range of voice,She ok still learning
3,It's an ok device. No more useful than a Bluetooth speaker connected to a smart phone.,It's ok
3,"It is very good, but very limited to the number of applications that it can support.","Great personal assistant, but should be improved"
3,"Alexa is great when asking about the weather, or when wanting to play some music quickly. However, majority of the questions I ask it cannot find. I think that the questions are pretty simple too. She will answer questions with direct answers like ""whats 2+2"" but if you go much further she wont respond.","Decent, don't rely on the TV comercials..."
3,"It was fun for few weeks until my kids starting asking all sorts of questions to Alexa. Amazon released a smaller version of Echo called Amazon DOT. Which is for half the price of Echo. DOT doesn't have speaker like Echo. But for people who are not playing music through Amazon Echo, DOT might be the way to go","More like Google voice, Siri"
3,Good just complicated too many apps to download...,Alexa doesn't understand a lot of things
3,"Alexa can do basic things, hard to find tune skills",Learning curve
3,This is a neat product but did not fit my needs.I have several bluetooth devices and some could not be recognized so I did return it. Might be good for others as what did work worked ok.,Ok
3,Good speaker but limited if you don't have a big music collection. I wish it did more,Good speaker
3,"So I was excited to get this when Best Buy started caring them. The thrill for was short lived. First week was fun to use it for music, weather, cooking, and jokes. But after that I lost interest. Attaching to my Hue lights and Nest were a longer process to make it work. I'd rather pull my phone out. Plus with a 2 story house it is useless if not on the same floor. Maybe I'll buy it again or a 2nd version when its released",Great buy lacking.
3,This is great for a connected home. People who use this should buy it if they plan on making everything in their home wi-if enabled. Otherwise it's an expensive SIRI.,"Great for a ""connected home"""
3,"I purchased the Amazon echo a little over a month ago. I like the concept of the echo but unfortunately it's not as responsive as I had hoped. Trying to get local news is nearly impossible. It's also not in sync with my Amazon account. Packages I ordered on Amazon that are delivered, it will still tell me are still in route. I think the speaker is a decent quality and I stream music quite often. I probably would not buy it again. Too expensive for the limited things it can do. Again, I like the concept but it still needs a lot of improvements.It's advertised as though it will make your life easier but other than creating a shopping list for me, I have not had an overwhelming life enhancing experience.",Not as great as I expected
3,After the initial trial questions found our Alexa's vocabulary is minimum and does not respond most of the time.,Not what I expected
3,"I purchased this product during a recent sale. I am loving it. From streaming music to my phone, setting alarms, checking my schedule, and playing music. I also purchased some smart switches and am able to control several devices using my voice. Lately I have noticed that I am having to repeat the wake up phrase sometimes. However, this is not a big deal.",New toy
3,It is okay so to speak. It does what it says it will. I feel it has much more potential however and look forward to updates.,It isn't bad
3,Nice sound quality and connects to my iPhone. I listen to Pandora and books and it's great,Love it
3,"Mainly use for music and to-do/shopping lists. Inquiries about basic information are answered with accuracy, but more complex questions (""describe the limbic system"", etc) are not answered. Sound is average.If you are looking for in depth answers, this device will disappoint you. Great for fairly common stuff.",Good but has limitations
3,"The echo is a nice speaker that has the added bonus of being able to respond to questions and give sometimes useful information. However in regards to it being capable of serving as the brain of an integrated, automated home, it lacks much. I purchased it to use with Philips hue bulbs and I was hoping my fire tv. Although it shares the same software with the fire, and logically should be able to work together, it does not. Echo will not connect to or control the tv. As far as the Philips hue bulbs, it can turn on individual bulbs, or even a group of bulbs IF, and only if, you remember the exact phrase or name you gave it. It cannot dim the lights, set light scenes or any of the cooler options the Philips hue bulbs are capable of. I wound up going back to using my iPhone which respond to voice command of 'hey Siri' better than the echo anyway. If I had to do it over again, I would have saved the money and gone with a simple Bluetooth speaker for my phone as it can already do many of the things the echo does. Only difference is that the phone doesn't have as big of a range for voice pickup.I did give the echo three stars, because the one thing it does well is respond to questions, like what's the weather like. That feature is interesting but not worth paying nearly $200 for.",Nice speaker with extra features
3,"Alexa is OK for basic weather and turning on/off a light you have linked on your network. She still has some issues understanding basic commands and i would love to see skills from major airlines that allow you to check flights before you drive to the airport. The music sound quality is good and you have to be an Amazon Prime member to really see value there. Hopefully, in a year it will turn out to be a good investment.",Not quite there
3,"Takes to many requests for Alexa to understand what you want. Have to ask several different ways to get most radio stations. When you ask for Rush Limbaugh, you get country music stations. Alexa must be sending me a message.",Not ready for prime time
3,"Amazon echo dosent hear well when the music is on full blast, but when you do get thru she's very acurate .",It's Ok
3,"I like Alexa, but limited. Can't connect with I-Tunes account yet. Can only set a one time alarm with 24 hours and cannot make it recurring. I see improvements weekly, but still a long way to go.","I like Alexa, but limited"
3,"I bought one for myself and a couple as gifts, it's cute but still haven't figured out what's so great about it. I will say that it does pick up your voice throughout a huge room.",Gift product
3,"It's a fun little toy but lacks practicality. In order to make it user friendly, I recommend a battery for it. You will also need Amazon prime in order for the music to play worth a darn. Otherwise you will be stuck searching through your phone for your song.",Decent if you have money to burn
3,Responds quickly. Hears my command from quite a distance. If you buy into google schedule (monthly fee) it helps you keep track of appointments birthdays etc.,Works Just Fine
3,"I thought it would do more, eg. be able to integrate with my cell phone to make calls or send text messages",Okay as a start
3,This is a neat little device but really not that good for much. I am sure it will improve in the future but I would recommend waiting it out.,Needs Work
3,"A little disappointed with my first experience with AI. You have to learn to communicate with Alexa to get results. I feel like she should have to learn more about me than I her. However I understand she is a GEN 1 and would expect that future versions will closer be to the Jetsons than something that keeps telling me ""I didn't understand what you said""! I doubt Amazon will update the existing units with better technology they will want to you to buy it all over again instead of making a loyal or invested customer happy. She does have a lot knowledge you just have to figure how to ask for it or download an additional skill/Application.",First experience with AI
3,It's a pretty good device but still has some issues with voice recognition,Has some Issues
3,"It did some things really well, like setting alarms and playing music, but there were too many times I would ask Alexa a question and she would respond saying she didn't know. I ended up returning it. Great promise, I just don't know that it is there yet.",Not bad
3,"I purchased this item for the home automation integration. Its pretty cool for just saying ""Alexa, turn on my kitchen lights"". Integrates with all the large players in home automation, Wink, Smartthings, Philips Hue, etc. Its also works well as a bluetooth speaker, streaming from your phone or tablet. It also streams Pandora and radio stations via TuneIn.It doesn't do anything useful other than that, besides simple queries about weather, etc.","Very good for home automation, for anything else?"
3,If it understands your question it works quite well. I enjoy it for music and basic knowledge.,Alexa has a hard time understanding me.
3,Had to spend 2 hours on line to make it work on line.,Not so good computer.
3,"I am an Amazon fanboy. I'll say it right up front. This device, although nice, currently has limited functions, especially considering the $200 price tag. So until more useful functions (linking to Google Now for instance) are added, I can only give my Echo as much as it pains me to do so, an average rating. Nice to have if you have extra cash sitting around and you don't mind waiting so see if useful functions will be added, but without Android syncing and functions,or the ability to control for example,TV channels, it's far from Amazon's usual ""gotta have it right now!"" category.","Nice ""tecky"" device, limited functions"
3,I I??ve used this for a month now. It works great 75 percent of the time. Alexa doesn??t always understand you. The mic doesn??t hear you when your 20 feet away.,Works great
3,"Since it is called powerfast, I thought it is a fast charger but it is not fast at all. It worked but it took about 5 hours to charge an almost empty Kindle Fire HD 8 inch tablet.",Not fast at all
3,I bought this because the package said it was a fast charger only to find it charges at normal speed... That was disappointing. I'm pretty sure I'm not doing anything wrong. It seems pretty self explanatory... :/,Disappointed
3,it does not charge any faster than regular charger.,not any faster
3,"It's a nice looking cover, will keep the Fire clean, but not particularly safe in a fall. (I have the black one. It is very professional looking.) No padding whatsoever. It does wake the Fire up when opened (and shut down when closed) but that has never been important to me. My problem with all of the cases is that you have to hold the cover out in order to keep the camera clear and it makes clicking the shutter a little awkward. I'd like to see an opening on the front cover that matches up to the opening on the back so you can have it folded in half and still be able to view the subject.",attractive case - may not protect in a fall One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No
3,"I would like to rate this 3 and half stars - while the adapter itself works just fine, I think it is underhanded of Amazon to make you pay extra for it. Maybe I am not technologically up-to-date, but it seems to me that most people charge things at a wall socket not with a computer USB port. I think that I read that charging with USB takes longer as well. Just like an airline charging you for taking your bags on the plane, now Amazon is charging you for things you need to make the Kindle work - pretty soon you'll have to pay for the cord, guides and updates. Not very good customer service :(",3 1/2 stars
3,"We bought this because we thought it would be great for reading books and playing a few games. However, awkward size makes the device very weird to hold and generally not enjoyable. The Fire HD 8 shares the exact same specs and has a higher battery life. There's almost no reason to take this device over the 8.","Get the Fire HD 8, Not the 10"
3,This is my 3rd Kindle. I have continued to move up on the screen size and this one is so easy to see and read. I do however sometimes have a problem with it when I am online. It can take forever to load up a site and move from page to page so that can be annoying. I have extremely fast internet so that is not the problem and when I check strength of wifi connection it always says excellent so not sure why it takes so long. Do not have that problem on my other 2.,My 3rd Kindle
3,the first one I got was very slow. I turned it in today and this one works great,not good and good
3,"I thought the tablet would be a little wider, its just too long",Fire 10
3,I don't care for having to close each window separately I would prefer to be able to select close all or exit all,ok but could be improved
3,"Got this Kindle Fire to replace a laptop that died. So far I have been very pleased. Finding new things that it can do. Not happy with the camera, but I might not know all the details about it yet.",My first tablet
3,I recently bought my fourth Kindle. I bought it because it is familiar and while there are improvements the keyboard is still difficult and not accurate. I also do not like the auto correct especially when writing a document. Browsing is quite good but I am a AOL user and Kindle makes it difficult to use. I definitely would like to see some improvement with making it easier to print.,Convenient.......but
3,For books games and internet it's perfectSound is a ittle weak,Very good for the $
3,"I do not find this as easy to use as my original Kindle Fire but I do like the camera a lot better, though it is not clear megapixels",Kindle Fire #2 for me
3,It is great for a bigger picture but runs really slow.,Kindle fire 10 inch
3,"Love the capabilities it has to offer.Downside, it totally shuts off by itself and you have to start what you doing all over again",Disappointed in it's performance.
3,"I have always been pleased with Kindle Fire. In fact, I think I wore out my previous one. For some reason I cannot turn this one on and went to Best buy to ask someone to help me with it. But it seems you need an appointment even for this probably simple chore.",not currently working properly
3,it wasn't worth my money to be honest but it is good whenever your bored,Okay
3,"The Amazon Echo Tap is a nice & interesting device...but it did not fit my needs. I also have the Amazon Echo and absolutely love it. So what's the difference? A. You have to walk up the the Tap to touch it - this is not as convenient and not as fun as the talking to the Echo from across the room. B. The audio quality not very good - more like a small bluetooth speaker. C. The Tap is fine around the house when it's connected to the home wi-fi, but when you are out of the house it must connect to your cell phone or other wi-fi?? That is not going to work very well.",So-so
3,I own an echo and the tap. The tap is slower to respond. If you haven't used the echo then you will like the tap.,It's ok
3,"Overall for an Alexa product it does the same thing as all the other ones. This one is specifically portable and only needs to be put on the base for charging. The one main issue is that it is not voice activated (meaning it does not listen to you unless you press any of the buttons on top or the mic button in front. By having this feature, I could see it causing excess battery usage. Needs to be able to apps better.",Echo Tap
3,"I was really excited for this speaker. Got it all hooked up to my echo and was ready to go. Then I listened to the music. It has no bass. If you want something the has a good range of sound, this isn't it. It is focused on treble only. No low end. I ended up getting the JBL Charge 3. Love it",I was excited but..
3,When it works it's great but for some reason it doesn't always answer me When it doesn't answer me I turn off the tv and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesn't work at that time. It was easy to set up with the phone app. Doesn't seem to matter where the phone is when it isn't working. I've tried close and far and in between. So a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesn't,When it works I love it
3,I returned it because I wanted better sound...opted for a bose soundlink. Decent speaker with nice amazon prime/Alexa features...just not the sound I was looking for.,Okay sound
3,Great device I use it on a regular basis. good investment,Great product
3,I recommend this speaker Easy to work great sound,Great speaker
3,You need to have amazon prime plus order a special music plan. Disappointing for sure. The sound is ok. I think the larger model is probably better.,Not what I thought
3,Having to press to talk steals the real thunder of what the amazon echo can do.,They missed on this one
3,Battery life is very long and the sound is surprisingly good. Alexa is not as 'smart' as the marketing would like you to think. I get a lot of 'I don't know the answer to that',Love the portability.
3,It works about 50% of the time when asking it a question.,Rarely gives a good answer
3,Would buy the cheaper one than I bought.The echo is a better product,ok product
3,"Great sound, it needs to be a little more sophisticated in responding to inputs. For example, yesterday I told it to play Mexican music -- didn't know any, same with Mariachi Music. Could not play any, Odd,",A little hard to teach it
3,"If you want a Tap to make use of Amazon's Alexa voice services, then dont get one. The Tap is a fine enough Bluetooth speaker for wireless music, but the need to touch a button for voice services renders it far less valuable.",Ok for what it is
3,"Alexa works great, but the the sound quality of this speaker is terrible, your much better off with a echo dot and bose sound link mini set up.","Alexa works good, but..."
3,Amazon Tap.. got it on Black Friday sale.. But so far feel not as easy as I think to use.. But if you just use as Bluetooth speaker and sound is good.. Maybe just have to learn how to use it more..,Not as good as I think..
3,"I wouldn't buy it again...the software doesn't seem as well integrated with the hardware on this machine. I also have an Echo and I don't have the same connectivity issues with it that I do with this. I liked the features available with this...portability mainly with a long battery life, but with plagued by connectivity issues I can't say I would recommend it. I have looked at reviews online since purchasing and have discovered I am not the only one that feels this way. The sound, when it is connected and responding, is amazing.",Not as great as the Echo
3,"This product is ok, wasn't too impressed with the commercial was defiantly more interesting",Ok product
3,"This product, while the speaker is great, fails to deliver with a voice interface. Use your cell phone or computer and buy an Echo Dot.",Tap - Fills a Gap That Didn't Need Filling
3,"The product works well. However, you have to hold down the button to use the best part of the device, Alexa. I really wanted to take it back because it can be a little annoying to hold down the button every time you have a question but the sound quality of this product is just so dog on awesome!!",OK
3,"Doesn't understand some commands or Questions,but good overall",it's good
3,Great sound..easy to connect..problem is.. its not voice activated..so u have to push the wake button anytime u need to use it..that means it has b close at hand...,Its a pain to use
3,I bought this as a Christmas gift. I'm told that they are enjoying it and are very Happy with all it can do.,Great gift idea
3,"Speaker is pretty loud and I love that I can take with me but the only downside is you have to hold the ""home"" button to use Alexa",Good Bluetooth device
3,Great Speaker but I really don't need the features. I just need good sound and don't really use anything besides that,"Great Speaker, no need for the tech"
3,My Echo hasn't updated to the latest version that allows for hands-free operation. I'm not sure what the problem is.,Hands-free
3,"Much better than the echo dot. However, the fact that you have to touch the button to activate it instead of just talking to it is a bit annoying. Speaker is fairly powerful for its size.",Voice command only would be nice.
3,Nice portable speaker but wish the sound quality was better.,Nice portable speaker
3,"I bought this and an AppleTV at the same time. The FireTV is just kinda OK. The interface isn't that intuitive and could use some polish. I had to enter the same username and password for multiple apps over and over (you only have to do it once on the AppleTV)...may not sound like that big of a deal, but it took much longer to setup.In my opinion, the AppleTV is a better product.",Just OK
3,"I returned this and purchased the 4th generation Apple TV instead, I liked the Apple features better. If you're not",It's ok
3,"I'm mostly happy, but like so many electronics, this one has a huge of built in advertising that you just can't get away from. There is no way to identify the aps you want to see first, and it always defaults the first click to an advertised movie for sell. It takes many clicks to get where I want, and the voice only works for purchases from Amazon, everywhere else you have to use the keyboard using clicks.",Slow to get where you want to be
3,I can't figure out how to use without switching out the hd1 plugs continuously .,Difficult to use
3,"Nothing really spectacular about this, weird interface. It is okay.",Does the job
3,"Software can be clunky to navigate. Certain apps are not available at this time for Amazon fire tv, only saving grace is my subscription to Playstation Vue",Lacks content unless you are a Prime member
3,I got it because a frend that really lime it. I had apple tv and still think is better than this,Works good not what I spected
3,"I got this to use while I travel because you can connect to Wi-Fi that has a webpage for signing in, like pretty much all hotels require. It was awesome for about two weeks. At first it worked fine with my brand new awesome Samsung 4k tv, then a week later the tv didn't even recognize it. Apparently it doesn't pay nice with Samsung. Not a huge deal since I bought it for traveling, then it didn't display correctly on the hotel tv, it was just a tiny piece of the picture and it was jammed into the top corner and the rest black. The next hotel, it looked fine but there wasn't any audio. COME ON. Really stinks.",Love but
3,"It's okay. When hooked up to my tv wirelessly, there seems to be a lot of lag. Seems to work better hard wired.",It's Okay
3,I hope to use it once I figure out how to use it. I am trying.,I haven't really figured out how to use it
3,"We're an unplugged family - multiple devices (Kindles, iPads, Roku, etc.) - so we're pretty familiar with this sort of tech. Fire TV works okay, but the remote has started giving me problems and we've only had the product for about 6 months. Our Roku 3, which we've had for over a year, is much smoother and hasn't given us any problems. We also use a Chromecast, which also seems to be less quirky than the FireTV. I have a PS3 in the same room as the FireTV and I find myself going to the PS3 when the FireTV starts to annoy. Unless you're looking for a device that can also run Kodi, I'd strongly recommend the Roku 3 over the FireTV.",Just Okay... Too Quirky
3,"I got this because I didn't want to set another cable box in my room. I don't watch a lot of tv to begin with. What I like about the fire tv is that you can download apps such as the Uverse app from att and watch live tv from it. And other apps like history channel, Netflix, food channel. You can also buy an app that lets you connect your smart phone to the tv. So if you have a movie on your phone or laptop that the fire tv doesn't have, you can connect it and mirror it and it will appear on your tv. Almost as having a cable box but you only pay once and not every month for it. The control does get disconnected a lot, I don't know if it's the Amazon batteries or if it's the remote. Over its good for someone who doesn't watch a lot of tv.",Does the job
3,Gives access to all streaming apps & doesn't seem too slow as far as responsiveness. Much better than the AF Stick. Haven't had any issues.,Decent
3,"The product works well except the WiFi drops every so often. Restart the firetv and it's fine. Also, the remote will sometimes not work. Pull batteries and put them back in fixes it. Kind of sad for such problems cuz I love the firetv.",Overall great product
3,"Decided to spend the extra money to get the model with more processing power for games. Other than the occasional heating up and the unit freezing, it serves its purpose",Great when it didn't heat up
3,"Although I had a Roku three that did most of what I needed, Playstation Vue isn't available but it is available on the Fire TV. If you have a prime membership, this is probably for you. If you are one of the people that don't like me, this is nothing but a way for amazon to get you to buy more stuff from them. You can't set the menu's to only show the content that you own and the apps that you have downloaded can't be put first on the list.",It streams your content
3,It was a great product but I purchased it for the Slingbox app. Last week it just stopped working on all my Amazon Fire Sticks and Fire TV. They say they are working on it but it has been about a week with no resolution. I am not the only one with this issue it seems to affect them all. Before that it worked very well. Better than expected. Not sure if they are going to get this fixed or not. If they get his fixed I would rate it a 4 to 5.,Great product until
3,"Tried IP controlling with a Control4 system, response was slow with button presses. Video quality seems better on Appletv",Little slow
3,"Works good, but a little cluttered display, I prefer the Roku",Works Good
3,"It works well when I use it everyday. However, it does not turn on when I do not use it for a few days. I pull out its power code and then it works again. I am not sure if I better to ask to replace it.",Defect?
3,It's a really cool device with a ton of apps but it often will freeze if left on to long,Glitchy
3,"I purchased this box in hopes of using it for the new Playstation Vue service which it did run pretty well. It does everything they say it does but one of the main issues I had with the original and still have with this is the interface. The layout for the main screen and the ads they throw in your face are just ridiculous. After using Roku for years, the Nvidia Shield TV, and the new Apple TV I would recommend any of those over this device any day. They offer a much cleaner interface and more functionality for the most part (except playstation vue).",Still not impressed
3,"Love it, but at times it just goes black. I have to unplug and hook back up order for it to work, sometimes multiple times. Same with the reg fire stick that i have on anther TV.",Love it when it works
3,"It is ok for the average user. But it os not good enough for Kodi. The interface is ok, but a little too busy for me. I did not like the fact that I could not use my universal Harmony remote with it. Jodi also takes almost an hour to set up and it buffers way more than on the Shield.","It is ok. If you need Kodi, get the NVIDIA Shield"
3,It's good but to get more connection and less buffing get the one with the Internet cable,Watch movies for free
3,I purchased the firebox for tv in living room. I later purchased fire stick for bedroom. The box downloads faster. Amazon has lots of good movies and tv shows. Excellent music selection,Faster than fire stick
3,This doesn't have the ability to control volume or turn off and on the tv. Liked the programming didn't like the features.,Didn't have the features I wanted
3,"it does what its supposed to do, turn ur tv into a smart tv altho chromecast has the upper hand because of its lack or chuggy connection to mobile phone",great product but mobile interaction limited
3,"So, its ok. I mean, it's not as fast or as seamless as the Apple TV, but it's cheaper. This is my 2nd one. The first one bricked after 15 months of steady use, so because the warranty was expired I bought a new one. I got it home and the remote stopped working for it on the 2nd day. I had just spent a week going back and forth with Amazon trying to troubleshoot my bricked firebox so I wasn't about to delve back into the quagmire that is Amazon customer service. I ended up just downloading the remote app for it instead. If you're a prime member it's a good choice, but if your not just get an Apple TV or roku.",It's ok I guess.
3,"The old Fire TV's had an optical audio out S/PDIF, the new ones only have an HDMI output. Great if you have a new A/V setup that has HDMI pass-through on the receiver, not so good if you want to run video through HDMI and audio to your receiver.I should have probably considered a Roku.",Not what it used to be
3,"Have not used for standard fire tv features. Bought to run kodi, which it works fine for. Freezes occasionally needing hard reboot. Worth the extra $ over doing kodi on streaming stick which lacks memory / cpu.",bought to stream kodi
3,I would like this product a lot more if it came with a remote control that is not as small as the original,Remote
3,"It works well, it's the same as using the firestick to me just cost more.",Same as firestick just more features
3,I had trouble with the device interfering with my internet connection. It would cause my wifi to disconnect. I could not toggle between the device and other devices. After I figured it out it works fine,It works ok.
3,very similar items as the stick. able to use a sd card in addition,love it
3,Easy to use.Easy to connect with cellphone and tablet to play YouTube. The product said it will upscale to 4k quality but the picture show on the TV is the same as regular product without 4K.,Great product
3,It reboots sometimes but it beats paying cable bill,Firestick
3,"I have a hard time navigating the menus and use is not intuitive,",Product is hard to use and eats batteries.
3,"i purchased this in hopes of making my existing tv a smart tv, honestly i was kind of disappointed. for starters the remote quite a few times lost sync with the box and i had to download the fire tv app to reset the box. second it froze constantly in the middle of using amazon prime it would freeze up. now this might just have been the bad one in the batch, i dont know but i returned it and are looking for something different.",just okay
3,"I bought this hoping to get a responsive android streamer, but was disappointed with the performance and the ""4k"" that was somewhat limited. I decided to return this and get an Nvidia Shield, which offers more value, instead.",Cheap Streamer but underpowered for demanding user
3,Spectrum works with Roku and smart cast app so we had to return and get a roku. Don't buy if you want to stream Spectrum to TVs without a cable box.,Not compatible with spectrum to stream live tv
3,This product is no different than the fire stick in my opinion it does have more memory and an option where you can add an SD card to it but other than that it is the same as a firestick no reason to pay twice the money for this box,No different
3,I have two amazon fire sticks. They were nice but kind of slow. Got this amazon fire tv box heard it ran faster which it does but the remote dies faster... A little over 30 days of course after the return period the remote sizzled. Good thing for the remote app.,Amazon
3,The media player is compact and low profile. The remote is nice. The unit/remote freeze up quite often requiring the player to be unplugged to reset it. This may be due to the fact I am running Kodi. I do have a first generation firestick with Kodi that does not freeze up like this unit. The performance differences between the firestck and this unit are negligible in my opinion.,Nice media player
3,"I bought and returned this item. I was hoping to be able to watch different sports games via the internet with the Amazon Fire TV but everything I selected stated it wasn't available. After trying different things for a few days, I figured I wasn't going to get the results I wanted and returned the unit.",Wasn't what I was expecting
3,Sometime it just stays in sleep mode and you have to restart it,Ok streaming box
3,"Not many negative things to say. It's solid, and comes with a lot of preloaded content. Sign in with your Amazon account email and you're set. Use a USB dongle and wireless keyboard to really streamline your input, in case the voice command leaves you frustrated.",Good Entry Level Streaming Box
3,We're finding it hard to navigate this thing. Others (mostly the young ones) think it's easy.,Fire Stick - still trying to figure out how to use
3,"I found the Fire TV to be a good box for streaming, but not great. Two things that stood out is the low internal drive space and so so speed.I would recommend it, with a clear understanding of the short falls.","Good product, not the best."
3,"It's so hard to decide If i should recommend this device or not. It's super fast, gorgeous images processing when paired up with my Sony 4k. However, it doesn't have turn off button. You have to make it ""sleep"" to turn it off, or else they will keep turning on and keep draining your wifi resource. Too simplistic controller make it hard to type. No option to sign in and out of an app. You have to wipe the app clean or reinstall the app to sign into another account. These can be easily fixed with better software.",Good and Bad
3,There doesn't seem to be much for 4K programs. Hopefully more to come.,It's ok.
3,Works pretty good but it's slow or glitchy. Either way it's good for the price.,Slow
3,I have bought 3 of the amazon fire tv boxes. I love how many online services you can access via the fire. I would rate this a perfect 5 if it was not for the fact that the fire remote is so poorly made. 2 of the 3 remotes died before the batteries did. Sure you can use your phone to control the fire tv box but that is slow and should not have to be done. And dont try to get help from Amazon their idea of help is to have you buy a new fire tv box.,Great product but the remotes are junk.
3,"Great for online content such as movies, TV shows, Music and games from the Amazon online store as well as streaming stored content from networked pcs or NAS boxes. You can also side load applications such as KODI for online content if you consider getting rid of cable television.I gave it 3 stars because even though it will allow for high definition video and theater surround sound, competing products can do those better.",Ok for cord cutters
3,Just my . opinion but i like the Apple tv better. Just easier to use,actually like apple tv better
3,Its good to have along with cable. Hopefully you get one as a present and not purchase yourself,Its Ok To Have
3,Enjoying it not so easy to setup but once you get it all is good,Great
3,"Three star due to the fact that sometimes the fire tv remote doesn't work. I will then use my smart tv remote. Other than that issue, I would give five star.",The star
3,I like the $39.99 firestick better. This one does not have all the stuff the other one has and the sales clerk saud that it did.,Firestick
3,I'm not to Happy with product. Very cheap .I wouldn't recommend it anyone,Ok for people who don't know what there doing
3,Currently enjoying the learning experience. We have not dived whole-heartedly into the many channel options,Cool Fire TV box
3,I bought this as a result of my television internet connection being faulty. This was a good alternative to purchasing a new television set. It serves its purpose. My biggest issue is setting it up aesthetically with my television and sound bar,It fits
3,Great product for what it is designed for. Easily modified for Kodi,Excellent for acquired content
3,It works. Not as user friendly as roku. Not as many apps as roku. No google play store.,Works
3,Its an okay product. It is geared towards amazon users. Doesn't have apps that roku or apple tv have. I got it for the direct now and it froze every time I used it.,Ok Product
3,"Looking for a streaming media box? This is a fine android based one..it has an Ethernet port, streams, does 1080p, Amazon, and if you have all android stuff it's fine..I really don't like that it doesn't have a volume control..the only difference between this and the fire stick (for me) is the internal storage capacity, and the Ethernet port..so but two fire sticks instead of one box, unless you want to play the apps",It's fine..
3,"Works great, but don't like how you have to spell everything out.",Works good
3,"Fast. Almost no buffering. Overall a great product. But only complaint is it's seriously slanted toward Amazon Prime. For instance, I have AMC through a cable subscription. Then why do I need to pay again for episodes on the Amazon AMC app? So stupid. With Roku, I don't need to pay anything extra for episodes I'm already entitled to.",Good but annoying
3,"Owned roku for years. Bought fire tv to root to watch free tv and movies. Only a few apps vs roku. Roku-user friendly more apps.Fire tv- free movies, free recorded tv",Just ok
3,Was tired of getting ripped off by Greenlight cable so decided to do something about it.No monthly charge or late fees for movies.,it is better than having to overpay for cable
3,"IT WORKED AS EXPECTED, WHAT MORE CAN I SAY ABOUT A USB DEVICE",OK
3,"I thought there would be a bigger step up from the fire stick. Honestly, if you want to save money, just go with the fire stick.",It's good not great
3,"Although faster than the stick and smart tv apps, it still needs more on stability and better connection for everyday use. Mot worth it if it was more expensive. Still ok.",Not ready for mainstream
3,Price was right. Bought it mostly to be able to watch movies but the quality of the movies is not as good as I had hoped which is the main reason behind my average rating.,Good price and easy to install
3,"This is an excellent device and easy to use. 5 stars if you have Amazon Prime and want to use what's included with Prime. But if you don't have Prime, any Android TV Box would be better at half the cost.",Depends what you're looking for...
3,I have way more buffering with this device than I do with my Apple TV 4 gen. It works just not well. I have a glitch with this unit every time I use it. That indeed takes away from the user experience.,Not great not terrible
3,"After reading how fast this unit was, I was highly disappointed. My Roku 3 leaves the Amazon Fire Tv in the dust. It takes forever to load up, then freezes several times while being used.",Not too impressed
3,i really like shopping at best buy in avon indiana,Really good
3,"I got the FireTV stick more than a year ago. It works fine although streaming video from my NAS sometimesnot very smooth. As I found the NBC Sports app allowed me to watch Olympics on the stick and this FireTV was on sale, I upgraded to this box. The result is a mix. It does stream video better than the stick but the same app did not work on the FireTV as with the stick It keeps giving the authorization error in playing some video clips. Withe same account, I can play the same video clips on FireTv stick or on Android boxes and tablets. I decided to keep it simply because of the great price I paid.",Just a little better than FireTV stick
3,"If you're already fully committed to the 'Amazon' ecosystem - as in: you have a Prime account, then this is a decent buy. I found it hard to get used to having advertisements in your face, and all the Amazon branding you see everywhere. Aside from those annoyances, the device itself is quite sleek and works fine for Netflix/Hulu/Amazon Video streaming. Playing files directly from a USB drive or MicsoSD card was a bit clunky but still do-able. An active internet connection is required to use most features of the device.",Only for True Amazon Lovers
3,I didn't see that much of an improvement from the fire stick so I don't think it worth the extra cash. Decided to go with fire stick to save a bit.,Not much better than fire stick
3,"The Fire TV is a good device with a powerful processor and the best Playstation Vue interface. However, it can be frustrating to access the channels you've added as you have to either search for the channel or thumb through them all - one by one. The Roku allows you to arrange your channels in whatever order you choose. The Roku has the most channel options - including Vudu (a channel not available on the Fire TV). Still, if you intend to use the Playstation Vue service you'll be much happier with the Fire TV.",Powerful but Lacking
3,Netflix app runs great no buffering and good HD quality. Amazon app and movies have their issues. But overall I like my fire tv. If only Amazon ran like Netflix then would be 5 stars.,Good overall
3,"I do like the Amazon TV idea. I do miss my DVR. I also miss all of the LIVE TV abilities though. Until Amazon TV gets LIVE TV abilities, this only gets 3 stars. Works well. Easy connect. But there are alot of reasons to miss Cable tv!! The channel selection needs to improve!",Amazon TV is a good option Vs. cable
3,"We've tried several of these little streamer boxes - Fire TV, Roku3, Apple TV (not the newest one). I think the Roku is my favorite. This one is competent, if you have Amazon Prime you'll miss it on the Apple TV. But the voice command mode - the one distinguishing feature of the Fire - is not useful. It only searches Amazon content and while Amazon has a lot of stuff we watch more on Netflix, HBO, Showtime, Hulu, etc. So, not so useful. I would get the Roku. The remote with headphones is a great feature.",Competent but oversold
3,"A bit dissapointed in local station reception. Fire tv is not what was expected. OK, but just not as expected.",antenna and fire tv
3,"This product is well made, durable and reliable. I have had good experiences with this manufacturer. I recommend this manufacturer and this particular product. This product does exactly what I need it to do. Super easy to use. I have used other manufacturers in the past but have not always been satisfied. I am happy with this product.",Well Made
3,"Very ideal for viewing movies, and th selections very updated!",Selections are good!
3,I would not purchase this item again as there is no 4K content.,No 4K Content
3,This item is a waste of money as none of the content is 4K. Buy the much cheaper Fire TV Stick instead.,Does not have any 4K
3,"Good performance for most apps. However, I primarily purchased it to watch PS Vue, and although the PS Vue app is better than on Roku, it suffers from more lag and glitches than watching PS Vue via PS4 or PS3.",Solid Streamer
3,Ok I need to learn how to use it I would recommend,It's a ok system
3,Better price point than apple TV but in comparison for what I am interested in prefer Apple TV,"Good device, prefer Apple TV"
3,"navigation needs more work, no pointer feature sucks, definitely NOT a point-and-click systemes explore for web browsing is antiquated and needs replacedvoice alexa feature does NOT work inside apps to control the app, so careful what you say or needless purchases are madeno disable option for voice featurestill one of the cheapest ways to run kodi program direct to telly in HDMI tho.one can still load app for plex server for NAS playback via streaming, though it is extremely difficult to navigate the plex download page in es explore.its faster than old version, has Bluetooth 4.1 instead of 3.1, has a quad-core instead of dual-core processor, and doesn't seem to get hot after hours of play like old version did.But, If Amazon ever blocked third party apps like kodi and plex I would never buy an amazon product again tho.Not an amazon prime member and never will be, why pay for programming that I can get for free.",still only okay
3,I would recommend this for anyone. Real happy with it.,Great I really like it!
3,Rather would have the fire stick as it is smaller and cheaper. I feel as though it has the same features.,Not worth the Extra Money
3,Works but has a tendency to freeze or get slow. Probably wouldn't purchase again,Works but not great
3,"Good Average device for internet content but for 4K forget about it, but if your looking for a simple HD content is good enough.",Good but not that good
3,Good compared to other systems like Roku but really need to get an easy way to close apps running in background.,Good but needs some work
3,I have to unplug it and wait 30 seconds every time,Satisfied Overall but...
3,"Not enough free programs. Even with a subscription to Netflix, etc. you still have to pay for most movies, shows.",Okay Addition to TV
3,"flips between Prime, Netflix, and Hulu quickly and easily & lot more",Easy and Fun to use
3,This is a good product the resolution is clear and very pretty. Glad I bought it.,convenient
3,Good product. Good speed. But freeze many time. Recommend a power on button on remort controll,Attractive and powerful
3,Needs more apps and has bugs that need fixing.....,Needs more apps
3,"This is a very wonderful streaming product. It is fast and has numerous app capabilities. There are some flaws though. The remote sometimes doesn't work then you'll have take out and put in the batteries, but you can use you're phone as a remote, it is faster and easier that way too. And it doesn't support VUDU or Crunchyroll. You can only real put this divice to its full potential if you're a Amazon prime member",Nice little streaming device
3,Great for streaming movies to your television. ...,Tech
3,"The device itself is good designed.I'm Amazon prime member, but found that the amazon prime video/tv isn't that good. Can't find many good video to watch.",Video source in Amazon isn't enough
3,i was using the old fire tv but this one is better after all the updates,Really fast device...
3,"Just like the reviews said, the Netflix app buffers every few minutes...AWFUL.....now I only have to glimpse that spinning red circle and my blood pressure rises. (I was hoping I would be one of the minority. =( ) . I finally yanked the HDMI cable and attached it to my computer to finish watching my program.I'm not returning the Amazon Fire-TV yet, because I recently acquired Amazon Prime and I've been hearing great things about their selection of movies, etc. Will update after I've used it for that.",If your main interest is watching Netflix-hold off
3,"I purchased it to see if the stream speed would be quicker than my Amazon Firestick but was disappointed.The stream speed is at the mercy of your internet provider.The processing speed is faster than the Firestick but in the end it has the same memory as the Firestick.For the price, the Amazon Firestick is better if all you do is stream... It might be a good fit for gamers.",Great speed average memory
3,"Fire worked fine and was simple to set up. I must add, however, that the overview menu should have more than a few on-line locations (Apps) like Netflix and YouTube. It should work as a main menu whose apps include things like liveTV, DiscPlayer, and even phonograph. Instead, it is pretty much all-Amazon. At least, if it was easy to access, it was Amazon. Aliza was not all that helpful either for non-Amazon material, certainly not for TV shows that are not in the Amazon library. I think it is a mistake to make me change source to access almost anything but Amazon. I was spoiled by my previous (Old Sony) BluRay Disc Player that did indeed act like a central menu for everything -- including Amazon. I may be showing my age and ignorance here, but I bet I have lots of company. I say KISS for usage, even if it means a more complicated install.",Amazon Centric
3,worth it to spend the extra 50 dollars and get the box w game control,great
3,Not much of a selection for shows or movies. Hopefully changes,Ok for previous shiws
3,the concept is great! We have had some issues with certain streams being unplayable and it is sometimes difficult to find what you are looking for. There needs to be an easier way to maneuver and find the things you want to watch.,good concept but has some issues
3,Apps and streaming run great. Searching and growing movie and show selection could use some tweets.,Good streaming center
3,Good productThe only thing I don't like is that the remote is unresponsive some times. All in all good steaming device.,Good product
3,Ordering process was easy and as expected. Hopefully my husband will install it soon.,So far so good
3,"I really love how this product works. It is fast and easy to use when the erthernet cable is connected to the router. The WiFi distance to the router is very poor. You almost have to put it next to the router. My TV is about 50 feet from the router and I am able to use nextflix WiFi without any lag, but the Amazon fire TV is not in range. It is in range right next to the router.","Good product, but WiFi distance to the router poor"
3,Good to have for your at home entertainment. It has every app known to man.,Good to have item....
3,"I tried giving this a chance being that I'm an Amazon Prime member but in comparison to my 4th generation Apple TV, it falls way short. I really just wish Amazon would develop the app for tvOS.",I like Apple TV better!
3,"Nothing really great about it. It's basically a box to watch Amazon on demand. I have a smart tv, so to me this useless.",Just ok
3,"Set up was easy and load times and picture quality is amazing. The only set back is you have to purchase pretty much anything. I understand buying a movies , but to have to buy tv episodes is a draw back. I could just stick with my direct tv for that",Works good
3,"I got this because my fire stick always gives a warning that it is too hot. Haven't had this problem but did experience problem. I have my ps4, apple tv, running through a hdmi switch. no problem when I had the fire stick plugged in. The amazon TV will not work with the switch. For it to work it needs to be connected directly. I have three tv's and three different switches didn't work on any and yes I tried different chords. Other than that works great.",doesn't work well with others
3,Can't stream smoothly unless plugged directly into the modem. Buffering was horrible (did not have this problem with Roku). Even plugged in it has some trouble with buffering at times. Only bought this because I got Playstation Vue and it only runs on certain systems. Unless you actually need the Amazon Fire to stream something only it can stream I would not recommend it. Roku is a much better system.,"Not the best, just OK"
3,"Not sure what will happen if it gets dropped, Doesn't appear to adequately cover the screen, Looks really good!",Look is great but I'm concerned about the protecti
3,Is a god but i have to pay 100 dollar a year is to bad,good
3,"I was exited about it but got disappointed. Same old GUI , 4K is limited. Search option is only for Amazon ...",It's okay
3,"It kept freezing when I first hooked it up. I couldn't type anything in because it kept resetting. After a couple days it started working, when I was ready to return it, so I decided to keep it. Need to be patient with it.",Just ok
3,Good streaming box for 4K with Netflix and Amazon prime. Has issue with sound not balanced or randomly lowering or going really loud.,Good box with sound issue
3,"I had the first generation fire tv and I really don't see any reason to upgrade. Sure it has 4k support but only for Amazon movies, not Netflix. I returned this device.",Just ok
3,Got 1 of this when it 1st came out. Returned the unit coz it won't boot up. Advantage buying from Bestbuy easy exchange or return. The second unit that i got works perfectly.,Works good after amazon updated firmware.
3,good product did care for the remote but product still good,good product
3,I wasn't really impressed. The remote broke within 1 hr of using it and had to return it.,eh :/
3,Fire TV was just about equal to the nexus player. and it it more expensive,took it back
3,Good FireTV but remote is buggy. Other than that its a FireTV.,Good FireTV but not great
3,I was a loyal Roku 3 but since I got a 4K tv I wanted something that streamed 4K. The Fire TV has a lot of good qualities but the fact it constantly resets randomly is frustrating for sure. I have the highest speed internet via Comcast so I don't understand why it's doing that.Amazon prime is great so it's not bad just need the bugs worked out for a higher rating from me.,Nice 4K content needs work though.
3,"This cover is a replacement for the initial cover that broke my kindle framewhere the top hinge goes into the Kindle. The metal on the original hinge system was too light weight to withstand having the cover fold all the way back on the Kindle and after just over a year resulted in the hinge becoming bent up towards the frame and it cracked the frame on my Kindle.I understand this new Kindle cover is supposed to have corrected that problembut the hinge system looks identical to the one that was on my old cover. I hope that over time, again, about a year plus it won't crack the frame in the same place again on my new Kindle.I am so thankful that Amazon replace both my Kindle and the book cover as a result of this problem.I would recomend that after about 6 months use it would be wise to remove the cover from your Kindle and see if the top hinge is beginning to bend upwards towards the frame and if so contact Amazon before the frame of your Kindle breaks where the top hinge inserts into your Kindle.",Kindle Cover Issue
3,"This is not appreciably faster than any other 1.8 or higher amp charger when used with my Kindle, Kindle Fire, Kindle Fire HD, various Android tablets, and other devices that have USB charging cables.It also blocks an adjacent outlet. Why didn't they put the plug on the short end like the original black-and-white Kindle chargerIt is an exceptionally good deal when purchased together with a Kindle Fire HD on promotion, but the regular price is not competitive for a supposedly premium charger.Additionally, it does not come with a cable, an omission that many people won't realize.**EDIT** I appreciate the many comments, but Amazon promotes this charger as something that charges faster than other chargers, but I haven't seen any such advantage. At promotional prices, it's a good deal, but not at almost twenty dollars. Otherwise, look elsewhere.**EDIT** When the review was written, the description of the item did not have this statement Optimized for Kindle tablets: PowerFast is a 9W charger and will charge your Kindle tablets faster than the white 5W Kindle charger will. That line was added a considerable amount of time after I wrote my review.",Not appreciably faster than any other 1.8A charger
4,I've had my Fire HD 8 two weeks now and I love it. This tablet is a great value.We are Prime Members and that is where this tablet SHINES. I love being able to easily access all of the Prime content as well as movies you can download and watch laterThis has a 1280/800 screen which has some really nice look to it its nice and crisp and very bright infact it is brighter then the ipad pro costing $900 base model. The build on this fire is INSANELY AWESOME running at only 7.7mm thick and the smooth glossy feel on the back it is really amazing to hold its like the futuristic tab in ur hands.,Good!!!

4,"I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account.

4,Ticks all the boxes I was looking for at a price I was happy to pay. One caveat that I (or the Best Buy and Geek Squad crews) was unaware of: there is a glitch in the keyboard that prevents it from working properly. Kindle/Amazon are aware of the glitch and will download a third-party keyboard fix to replace the keyboard that's built in to the unit until they are able to fix the problem.

4,I enjoy it more then the I-pad that its replacing. Easy to read in any light and the size is perfect for travel.,great for the price
4,I bought this for my dad in his late 60s mainly to listen to music and read ebooks borrowed from the library. I set it up for him and he loves it. I just don't like that it has ads on the start up unless you pay to get rid of them.,Great for the price
4,Enjoy reading books on it as well as viewing videos.,Good for the books.
4,The overall design makes it fir very nice in the hand. It is very easy to setup and has features that I did not utilize on previous Fire tablets. I like the camera and the Blue Shade ability. I like to read before bed and the color really does help me wind down. Long lasting battery!,Easy to Use
4,So I think I would have rated 5 stars however when I got my tablet home my 8 year old used it for a total of 2hrs...the next day it had a reboot screen similar to Dos windows. Excellent customer service at store allowed me to exchange next day. No problems with the second one. Great tablet for the price.,Good for the price
4,"I tested this item before I gave it as a gift. It is simple enough for the needs of browsing, social media and entertainment. Definitely best price for simple needs compared to spending $100s on an iPad",Makes a great gift for first time Tablet Users
4,"This feels like an affordable tablet. While not the best in class, it isn't priced to be that either. Works well. Happy with purchase.",not the best in class but priced right
4,Great for watching sports events away from home but within wi fi range.,Awesome tab for the price.
4,"I would buy it again and have twice over already. I actually bought the kids fire kindle and bought this for my wife, her's was lost and she borrowed my sons kid fire kindle I ended up buying her this again, and would buy it again. I would recommend buying a sd card it fills up fast without out it but it is a lot cheaper to buy the lower GB kindle and then buy a good sd card.",I would buy it again

4,I got it at a great price. They price matched for me. Much faster then getting my laptop out to check email,Fun tablet

4,Bought as a gift to my dad and he likes it so far. It's fast enough for apps and great for reading,Cool product
4,"Works great but the app store is nothing like that of Apple or Google. Fortunately, you can install many Android apps from 1Mobile. The screen is fabulous and it's great at its roots: making reading books fun.",Great but alone
4,"I love this tablet. I know it's not an iPad or any of the big tablets but it does just what I need it to do. I've had it a few weeks now. I've downloaded videos, read a few books and played some games. I've had zero problems so far. I know it's not the best video, but for the price of the tablet I don't expect it to look like my flat screen TV. I'm trying not to load too many things to keep it from slowing down. So far so good. Browsing the internet is easy too. I'm getting used to the browser and the app store for Amazon. For the price of this tablet it's not too shabby!!!",Good tablet for reading and watching videos
4,Was looking to get an inexpensive tablet that ran Android. The Amazon Fire tablet was a much better value than other similar products. Have been very happy with the tablets durability and quality so far too. Would recommend to anyone looking for a lower-end tablet.,Great value
4,Good quality product. Clear display and easy to use.,Good product.
4,Purchased this for reading and the price. Good value for money.,Great for reading
4,Does everything a regular tablet can and for the price you really can't beat it,Love this tablet
4,"This is a nice little tablet for the $60 I paid on black Friday. At the regular price I would probably have gone with something a little less restricted and without so much Amazon content. The lock screen ads aren't much of a problem, I understand Amazon sells these cheap and gets it back via ads, but the 15-20 Amazon apps are a little much. It would be easier to stomach if you could add the ones you want or remove the ones you don't. That said, I was able to install the Google Play store and this tablet does everything I need it to do. Overall, I'm pretty happy with the purchase. It's a nice new toy. One note: In the online photos the magenta looks purple. It's actually pink. If you like purple, get a black one and a purple case.",Not bad for $60 BF Deal
4,"I have had a Kindle before, and needed a new one as the old one would no longer charge very well. Still adjusting to some different features from the original one. Do not like the fact that it is difficult to find a case for this one.",Kindle 8
4,"It's a good starter tablet, to bad it runs on the Amazon OS.",Good for the price

4,Love the tablet mainly use for games and internet. Grrat product foe the price.,Best value for a tablet
4,"She hasn't used the it yet, but my son did a quick check and it seems just fine.",Christmas gift for my daughter
4,"At ninety dollars, the expectionations are low, but this is still a very good table, it's good for light use like watching videos or web browsing, but the camera is a bit lacking, and at certain times the device can freeze or lag. Overall this is a good tablet for $90, I would recommend this to anyone on a budget.",You get what your paying for
4,"The Parental Options need some work. You can't even log in to a child account until you have Apps loaded for them to use. Also a kid's login doesn't have access to pre-loaded apps (like the calculator). Seems really odd to me that you can't give them access to basic functionality of the tablet.Otherwise, the tablet itself works great.","Works well, but Needs Better Parental Options"
4,You can't beat the price. Great deal for what you're paying.,Great price point
4,I love it.....Reading E books here is so easyPerfect for price,A very good deal

4,"I wanted a new tablet and saw the 7"" on sale at Christmas, my husband was offered the 8"" for just $10 more, so good value ! Thin and light weight. Easy to start up. I would have liked to have a booklet on featuers and use, etc. Nothing in print came with it other than one paper . Tutorials on set up and where the buttons and slots were. I have enjoyed the quick loading to start, just wish I had a physical booklet on how to's, not just online tutorials.",Nice for the price !
4,More features In several ways than iPad. This android tablet is really powerful,Nice tool!
4,Love the tablet! Easy to use and easy to take with,Great tablet
4,"It matters what preference you prefer with tablets. I mean if you use windows or google more this might not be for you. For me, I use Amazon music, video, books, and shopping so this tablet is awesome. It's made especially for Amazon ecosystem users. Its light and has a nice feel. I live the blue shade option it has for less blue light when reading.",Great Amazon Tablet
4,Great tablet other than the photo image quality is fuzzy and not the best.,poor photo quality
4,I will be ordering Amazon fire for my two granddaughters because they love Nana's so much,Great for beginners
4,Really beautiful display is great for watching movies and playing games. It is very powerful for the price and you can play lots of games from Amazon for free - they even remove microtransactions from lots of games.Only downside is you need Amazon Prime to get the most out of your tablet,Great tablet
4,Graphics are great for the price. Would highly recommend.,Great product
4,The pad worked as I thought but the screen wasn't as vibrant as our iPads. Still a great deal for the price.,Great Pad but still not the best
4,"I like the shape and size of this Kindle, and the graphics are good. But if I play a game for very long the charge seems to run out pretty quickly. It is very good for books and for music. I would recommend it for those categories.","Easy to read, but loses charge fast"
4,It is very easy to use for children . We have loved having one and are hoping to buy another one for kids Christmas !!,Great for children and learning.
4,good price for the product. I purchased for my middle school son.,Decent tablet
4,"A great Kindle reader. Easy to order, read and store books. Also speedy for finding Amazon products and ordering them. But the other apps are really slow - too slow.",A nice Kindle Reader
4,Easy to use as a tablet and easy to use as a ebook reader,Great ebook reader
4,"Not sure if this is due to the new version but I'm not able to install or even sideload certain apps onto the tablet. Amazon is really trying to lock out non-Amazon apps namely ones from Google. Aside from that though, performance is already and what you'd expect from a tablet in this price range. This was purchased for my mom and it does what's needed and my mom has no complaints thus far.",One flaw
4,Tablet is working good for what we wanted it to do.,Good tablet
4,"Still waiting for Alexa to function. Several calls to Amazon supportled to conflicting answers on how to get it to work, then told it isnot yet available on all Fire HD 8 tablets.","Great, but awaiting Alexa feature"
4,"The Amazon Fire Hd8 has great features. The size is perfect to carry anywhere. Excellent apps and accessible to books, movies, games etc. Clear screen. it was very quick and easy to setup and begin using.",Great features!
4,This tablet is a good one for everyday use. It is small but it has a clear image. Not sure if I really wanted one this small but its ok for now.,Its a good small tablet
4,"This does not run Android, so no Google Play store. Amazone apps are moztly the same titles, but not all are available that you can get through Google Play. Bought this for our daughter and she enjoys it. If you have an Amazon Prime subscription you can get a lot more out of this tablet as well.",With Amazon Prime it is a great tablet
4,bought as a gift she loves it great with amazon prime,good
4,Tablet is good for beginners and those that like to read,Good Deal
4,"It worked really well for me as I am unschooled in ipads. I used it while traveling and it was easy to use and did the things I needed, i.e. maps, books downloaded, internet access, youtube, etc.. I don't play games, so cannot comment on that.",Great ipad for a beginner such as I am
4,I bought this to replace a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. I absolutely love the Kindle HD 8. It was easy to set up and very easy to find my way around. The only reason I took off 1 star is that I have found some apps are not available for Kindle. But so far from info I have read online there are ways to resolve this issue.,Excellent tablet for the price
4,Just a simple kindle. Doesn't have the glass back.,Great basic kindle
4,"Well worth the 80 bucks, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member. You can download and watch anything on there for free, including movies and magazines. The screen is a bit on the darker side, but the battery life is great. I have both an IPAD and this, and I use both. Great when you are waiting for your IPAD to recharge...",Good IPAD alternative
4,Improved over the HD 7. Things set up differently but not hard to learn. Also a bit heavier than the 7 so reading in bed a little harder,Better than the Kindle HD 7
4,I've purchased a number of Kindle Fire products for family over the past several years and continue to use them. Easy to use for even my youngest Grandchildren or my 87 year old Mother-In-Law which they use as a reader and for games. An overall good value.,Good Value
4,"Works okay as a tablet and especially to access Amazon.No good as a general tablet as there are no Google apps available, such as Chrome, gmail, etc.",Okay tablet
4,"I believe it depends on how you want to use it. I bought this for my young kids and they are loving it. They can do basic stuff like surf the internet, watch youtube and play some games. The only complaint that I have is that sometimes it does not charge, even if you have have it connected for the whole night. You just have to restart the pad so that it can charge, but that is the only glitch.",Good for Kids
4,"Works well. I really like the bigger screen (up from the 7""). Easier to read, just as easier to use if not better.",Love of games
4,"I bought my Fire HD8 as an alternative to carrying around my laptop and having to buy many textbooks for college. The fact that I saved well over $150 on one of the 5 books I had to get this semester was a godsend. Most all undergraduate courses I have seen are offered in eBook form for Kindle. If you do not care about having the constant ability of being on the internet without WiFi or other hotspot, it's a great resource. Pros:Price for this was still less than the money saved for my Biology Book.A lot less weight that 5 college textbooks.So far all books I need for college are available as eBooks through Amazon.A single charge can make it through an 8 hour school day.Cons:If you want/need a network connection, you have to use your phone as a hotspot or connect to another WiFi network. Bottom line, I wanted a cheaper alternative to having to lug over $750 in books around. I came out at well under $500 considering I bought this.",Great Alternative to College Textbooks
4,My only disappointment is the inability to download some of the apps I use in my phone.,I like the Kindle Fire very much.
4,"I like this tablet. It has everything you want. However the apps within it need to be updated more often. If this happened than it would be top above an iPad mini. For now, it gives me enough of what I need and in HD. For $89 it was a good deal.",Solid tablet with potential
4,"Great inexpensive tablet for everyday use. It's not powerful enough for super graphical games but it's great for basic apps like surfing the web, emails, news, etc. Amazon has ""underground"" apps which is totally free (including in-app purchases). Only downside with those is that you sometimes see a full screen ads in them (usually products that's on your Amazon wishlist). All-in-all, it's a great tablet that you don't have to worry about if you break it.",Great Tablet
4,Great price of 89 dollars on a great tablet. It is very fast at everything accept game play. For example it plays asphalt 8 and the game is just barely playable. The graphics struggle on this tablet with higher graphic games. Also it is a Amazon tablet with no Google play store but you can load Google play on to it. There are great you tube videos on how to put Google play on a amazon tablet. The screen is good as long as the sun isn't hitting it. The stereo speakers sound great and loud. All in all I really liked the tablet for the price but I really like to play games with good graphic quality. So that being said I did return this tablet and ordered the Nvidia Shield 8 inch tablet through Best Buy for 199 dollars. I got the Shield a week ago and WOW!! What a difference in graphic gaming quality. This thing is just as good as an Xbox1 or ps4. The Nvidia Shield tablet is simply unbelievable for the price of 199 considering the Apple or Samsung tablets that are as fast as this tablet are at least twice the cost. Plus this dubbles as a gaming console for xbox or pc games with 4k out to you tv. The Amazon tablet is also a great tablet for normal usage but if your a gamer like me the Nvidia tablet is the tablet of choice hands down period!! I don't know why bbuy kind of hides the Nvidia tab only on their website and doesn't sell it in the store. If they displayed it in the store. This would outsell the Apple or Samsung tablets. I hope this helps thanks.,Great tablet at a great price!
4,"I use this primarily as a reader; however, it has a smaller number of unread books that are not in the familiar ""carousel"" as in other Kindle readers. As a tablet it is faster, brighter and more clear than other tablets that I have used for internet purposes. I would recommend this product to anyone who uses a tablet or a reader.",Good Reader with Internet benefits
4,Wanted to travel without my laptop. Found the Fire to be perfect. Used it mainly for checking email and keeping up with Facebook posts of friends. Found the size of screen to be easy to read. Typing a tad uncomfortable until one has some experience using it. Have yet to use as an ereader.,Great to travel with
4,"This is a great tablet. It has amazing storage. I use mine daily. Great for reading, surfing the web and games. The one small thing I don't like is Amazon prime shows are a bit dark for some reason. Hulu and Netflix work wonderful.",Great tablet
4,its good performance and highly recommended to amazon users,good for its range
4,"If you don't want or need something cheaper than an iPad but of quality, this is a great happy medium.The processor makes for a fluid ride with it. It's speedy. The Android Store gives you good app options and the Amazon ecosphere is everywhere here.The software is a touch buggy but it's still a great deal of a tablet.For a child, for something you want to use casually on a dime, it's recommended.",Bang for the buck . . .
4,Light to carry and good picture quality. This was purchased for a hearing impaired person to download video in American Sign Language . This product was easy to maneuver for someone that was not use to a tablet.,Great for hearing impaired in downloading videos
4,I love this tablet. I purchased them for gift and am so glad I did!,PERFECT!
4,"Very pleased with this device. Great price, easy to use, and light weight.",Great buy
4,"Very descent for a non-IPAD. Good speakers. Great price. The screen is a little dark. Great buy if you have Amazon Prime since you can download stuff and watch it offline (great for trips, etc...). Overall great cheap IPAD or even as a back-up tablet. Terrific battery life too.",Very descent
4,"Got this for my 9 year old after her ipad crashed and burned. She does not like androids at all but I couldn't afford a expensive tablet for her. So we took a chance with this one. She is pleased and I'm pleased it seems so sturdy , not cheap quality at all. Going to get our youngest child one now. Very pleased.",Really great for the price!
4,I like it but I had a hard time figuring things out.Do I get to talk to geek squad free? Can I come down to the store and get someone to help me with my questions.Will there be a fee for that service?,like product need some help w/questions
4,"Good tablet, great price, easy to use, pick up simple",Good tablet
4,"I am a power user; there's no other way of putting it. I work in IT and I research the heck out of products before I buy. I had an iPad Mini 2 that was just not up to snuff with iOS 10 so I sold it and bought (and eventually returned) the 2016 Fire HD 8. First let me say it's a great tablet for the price and for probably 50-60% of tablet users who surf the web and watch Netflix. It also helps if you are a heavy Amazon content user. For me, I was spoiled by the retina display on the iPad. The 720p display is alright, but you can see the pixels. 189ppi is pretty low by today's standards. The other big thing for me was the lack of a laminated display. It's glare city on this thing. Display nitpicks aside, it punches above its price point. If you don't play really heavy games (which it even plays Titan Quest surprisingly well!) and you don't mind not having an absolutely beautiful screen I think it runs and works fine. It just wasn't for me. I bit the bullet and went with a 128GB iPad Air 2 as its on special at BB for super cheap right now.",Great For Basic To Moderate Use
4,"GREAT value for the cost - not as fast as a high end tablet, but certainly faster than I was expecting. Clear viewing and easy navigation",Amazon Fire Tablet
4,Excellent price point for my basic requirements. It has all the features I need for comfortable reading of online novels and articles.,Great for my needs...mainly reading and games.
4,I bought the Fire HD 8 & CaseI use it mostly for class..works very good..would be better if it had BlueTooth.,Very Good Tablet for the Money
4,We have several kindles and this is the latest version. Its packed with Amazon marketing stuff which is fine if you use them but most just take up space for us. This new version comes with 16gb but allows you to expand the memory with an sd card which is great. One problem if you have a few other kindles is that they are linked to your account so if they are for different family members/kids they may end up with the same stuff on them. My kids mainly use them for game apps and YouTube videos which am seem to work great. The sound is good and the hd video is nice. Overall happy with it and the price was good for this type of tablet.,Decent tablet
4,"It's good, saves using up data usage on computer. I use it to keep up to date with the news.",works very well
4,My kids enjoy reading books and playing games on the fire tablet.,Great product and cost!
4,"At the price it is almost an impulse buy. I wanted a tablet for an upcoming trip to watch some movies, read, etc and this was at a price point that made the decision really easy. If you are used to an iPad, the Fire HD is a little disappointing but it costs considerably less. It fit my needs but I felt some slugginess and several instances of needing to reboot to get certain apps to work correct. If you go in with the understanding this isn't an iPad replacement this should fit the bills for you. Let's just say, after my trip I purchased an iPad Pro and this item will likely be handed off to one of my children. If you have Amazon Prime, you do get some nice perks that make this a really nice item.",Great for the price
4,Easy to follow directions allowed her to set it up with me watching over her shoulder.,Great for my mother in law

4,"Not the highest quality of tablet out there, but for the price you almost can't beat it, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member.",Nice little tablet for the price
4,I liked the screen size and easy to read books at night. The battery has a long life. The outer rcase could be stronger because concerned about durability.,Works good. Easy setup.
4,New Kindle replaced my old Kindle that had a lot of books. To my surprise the book transfer worked well. Seems to work surfing the net. Music sound is only okay.,Love it.

4,It was a good buy and tried this for a day. It was fast and experience was good.,It was a good buy
4,"I purchased this tablet knowing exactly what my needs were and how well the Kindle could meet them. Despite the ""walled garden"" philosophy that tethers you mostly to Amazon products and services, the ability (as of right now) to side-load the Google Play Store makes this a surprisingly versatile device for the price point.",A Solid Basic Tablet

4,"I enjoy the new kindle, only things I would like to change is the way screen darkens and lightens while reading. Not sure how to stop that. Occurs consistently. Also, would like to stop the ads seen each and every time kindle is turned on to start reading again. That is bothersome. Otherwise, am happy with the kindle.",Good
4,I purchased the 8 inch device. Also purchased black cover.I played for it and asked if I could get it set up and was told it would be 40 more dollars. I did not have 40 more dollars so I left the store with my kindle and had someone else set it up for free. I was disappointed I had to get someone else to set up my kindle.,Great device
4,I got this for my son to play games on soI could get my iPad back. Personally I think it's a great little tablet for kids and or for reading. Other then that it's not a high powered game playing tablet or anything to keep lots of storage on. But it works for what it's intended for andI have no problems.,Good for price.
4,Easy to use. Pretty user friendly. It is good value for the price,Great tablet for wife.
4,"My nephews love to play with my phone. Now as anyone who has been around small humans knows they have an astounding ability to perpetually have something sticky on their hands. However, if its a rare case where they don't they will probably drop the device from the lack of said stickum. The kindel has come to my rescue as it has everything they need to be entertained. And best of all it lacks the anxiety inducing price tag for that moment when the kids demonstrate Murphy's law in action.",Kid Friendly

4,"This is the third Fire we've purchased, and Amazon finally made this level memory-upgradable. That has made all the difference. I bought Fire tablets for use as a 'kid tablets', for which they work great...until you run out of memory. 8GB is practically nothing these days (I remember when having 64kb was a HUGE upgrade to my Atari!) so being able to toss in a memory card give my kids much more utility.",Much better
4,"I had the original kindle fire for ten years and I loved it. But it broke on me and I decided on this one after looking at all the upgrades from the original. It let's you do so much more, but some of the tutorials (like for the internet) weren't helpful.","Like a laptop, only smaller"

4,"I love my Kindle for reading manga and comics. The fact that the graphics are worse than my phone detracts a little from the expirence, but serves to remind me that I cheaped out and bought yesterday's model. This is not a real negative, it just appeares less crisp than my phone. The increased picture size more than makes up for it in my book.",Great tablet.

4,"This was an impulse buy. While getting a bigger, faster and much better tablet for my wife I decided I'd get this for myself. It did the job just fine, but after about a week I returned it. I just didn't find myself using it wnough to warrant keeping it.

4,"Bought this tablet to replace a 3 year old Galaxy Tab. This tablet is quick and easy to use, relatively streamlined. The screen is nice and the stereo speakers, while tiny, sound better than my old tablet. The modified Android system that Amazon is running on this tablet is good, just a bit restrictive. All in all a good tab for general browsing and popular apps.Pros:-Price-Performance-Feels sturdy-Easy to navigate-Silk browser works greatCons:-Not all apps are supported on here, like Telegram-Ads on lock screen feel unnecessary, but not a hindrance-Not as customizable as other Android tabs",Capable tablet at a bargain price.
4,"I bought this tablet mostly for watching movies. I downloaded movies from Netflix and watch them during indoor bike training at the gym. I love the ability to expand the memory with a microSD card, which iPads do not. It's pretty fast and has all the features I need. I read kindle books with it as well. The drawback is that some apps are not compatible with this device. The iPad is definitely more powerful and compatible with many apps I use, but this is a great tablet for most of my current interests.",Good tablet for the price

4,"Great little tablet to take with you, great for kids",Good value
4,Only problem is that it is impossible to read or do anything on the KindleFire with any light in the room at all; far worse than impossible in sunlight.

4,I like this and the price is right enjoying it now,great
4,I have a nexus 9 but it is painstakingly slow so I wanted something that does not lag Everytime I try to use the browser and does not freeze whilst playing games and this gets the job done very well.

4,"This is a good product but the one I bought stops working after three or four typed sentences and the Geek Squad guy told me when I brought it back that I had to go into settings and clear the data when it does that. WRONG ANSWER. That should never have to be done. He had no idea what he was doing and North Haven Best Buy didn't offer to fix or replace my Kindle. This is the third product I have had to go back and either return or exchange because it wasn't working properly or at all. One manager tried to excuse the store by asking me if I understand Best Buy doesn't actually manufacture these products. If that is the best they can do to explain why they, as the Point of Sale, keep selling defective products, the North Haven store has a big problem.",Very easy to use.
4,like the speed the 8 inch screen is great. Works well.,like it
4,"I bought this to replace a 7""fire hd tablet that broke. Amazon changed the operating system so it took me a while to figure it out. I set this up for my son with special needs. I tried to make it as simple as possible for him. It is a little bigger. The sound isn't as good as the previous fire tablet. It also seems very slippery. I got a rubber honeycomb type cover for it. That seems to help us to grip it better. Over all, it's a good tablet for a child. Just use parental controls, and get a good cover for it.",Fire HD tablet

4,I purchased this product on a whim with a very limited purpose which was to study for an exam while in the middle seat on a long flight. I expected to hand it to my 10-year old after my exam. The surprise was that really enjoy the device and in particular I like the Amazon account integration: On my next flight I was delighted to find that the unit actually downloads my videos for offline viewing! The best part is that I upgraded the memory with a 64GB SD card so now my available content is awesome! Truth is that my first unit inexplicably failed but Best Buy replaced my unit right away and I expect great things with this new device! My son also uses it on long trips!!!,Surprisingly GOOD
4,Able to download music and movies free!!!!!!!!!!!!,Awesome if you have Amazon Prime
4,"You cannot top the value at this price point with any other tablet. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the limited app selection through the amazon app store.

In my opinion it handles these two task perfectly. The screen isn't as clear and crisp like other tablets but hey I didn't pay $300 for it either. I like this size and it seems fast. I'd have to say I like it a lot. On another note, I'm giving this review only 4 stars because i am absolutely annoyed at Best Buy and their shipping. This is about the 3rd time I've ordered a product and had it shipped to me and Best Buy said it would be here at a certain date and UPS screws It up every time. Don't have any issues anywhere else but always when I order from Best Buy and have it mailed to me.

4,"As I reviewed different tablets, this tablet kept coming back as my best option for the items I was looking for. It IS a great tablet, but there are a few things I don't really like about it. I didn't realize that Amazon has it's OWN browser SILK. Everything even your banking info goes through Amazon. Not sure I like that. Also, items don't automatically close out when you leave a page and I have to frequently hit the button on the bottom and close out multiple items. It might just be that I am not THAT computer savoy, though I do know how to navigate my way around. Sometimes the touch feature just seems to freeze and won't recognize that I am attempting 'touch'. Lastly, the on/off button is right where you hold the tablet on the side, so I am often 'accidently' shutting it down. Most annoying! Overall, I am happy with my purchase and for the price I like it. Just wanted to point out the other items.",Mom's Firestick

This past Christmas we purchased the Amazon Fire HD8, 16 GB.This model was an improvement over the previous one. With twice the internal storage, my son wasn't always coming to me to delete games because he ran out of storage. Another great feature is the external SD card slot. We bought a 32 GB card and he's not had to delete anything.The quad-core processor is a big improvement over the previous gen model. Apps and games load quickly with not lag in running them. There also seemed to be an improvement in the battery life so it doesn't have to be charging all the time or plugged in the the power cord.This is a great purchase for any child!",Second Kindle For My Son

4,"If you are in the Amazon ecosystem, the Fire HD8 is a great choice for an inexpensive tablet. Very responsive, good screen, and so far the battery life has been great. The only drawback of the Fire is the apps are only available from the Amazon App Store, not the Google Play Store. For example, there is no Gmail application to install. But that's not what I use this for... Kindle reading, Netflix viewing, occasional Facebooking and light web browsing are well suited to this device. Can't beat it for $89.","Good tablet, great battery life"
4,"Runs Great, very efficient for what we use it for.",Great
4,"My kids have the older model fire, smaller version. They can spend hours on it. This is bigger, better version with a larger screen size. Each child is getting a different color so they know whose is which.",Step up from fire6
4,"I previously owned a Samsung Tab3. As a media device (for reading, viewing, listening, playing), the HD8 is fine, even a step up in screen size, clarity, and ease of navigation. However, the proprietary nature of Amazon's apps basically eliminates (for me) using it for work (e-mail, document & spreadsheet storage/retrieval/editing). Since I didn't buy it for its work capabilities, that's fine, but I think that would be annoying to a specific segment of potential users. At some point I will probably spring for a more-expensive updated Samsung tablet (or Windows Surface, if I'm feeling reckless), and the HD8 will probably be passed on to my 9-year-old.",Good Option Among Value Tablets
4,Easy to use reading device. Looking forward to watching movies on it. Great value,Great reading device
4,"It's was good for handling light weight and comfortable in hand. Good audio clarity, video everything is good. But only few supportable apps. Need more apps which we use generally.",Need more Apps

4,"Tablet work great, good battery life. Just not a lot storage, but has micro SD card slot.",Excellent tablet and battery life
4,"I really like the Fire 8 tablet but there are some issues to be aware of. Amazon seems to subsidize the low cost of the item by requiring you to be solicited by ads and and use their apps. Every time you activate it, the screen display is a full size ad that goes away when you swipe the screen. There is no Google Play so you can only download apps chosen by Amazon at their Appstore. Otherwise, pretty cool for the money.",Great tablet with caveats
4,This item is perfect for online reading and internet browsing. The only con is that Amazon doesn't have some of the apps that Google Play has.,Great for an ereader

4,It's very good product and I recommended this to buy it.,Very Good

4,"It's easy to use. I can check my email, play games from AppStore, headlines news, amazon deals & offers. Very reasonable price.",Great tablet
4,"Great tablet for the cost, does all the basic functions great. These are email, web surfing, and social media. If you belong to Amazon Prime then it's even better since this thing makes it easy to take advantage of the extra content you can access. Movies, TV Shows, music, books. A lot of this is free for Prime Members. Good idea and business move for Amazon as it encourages Amazon content and purchases. The tablet itself is pretty good, smaller and more narrow than an iPad. Easy to hold in one hand, screen is nice for video, reading, web surfing and email. If the iPad is setting the bar and is a 10, I would give this an 7-8. The weakest thing is the camera, it adequate but you smart phone is better. A feature it has that the iPad lacks is the ability to add an Micro SD Card for extra space. It is also much cheaper than an iPad.","Great basic tablet, best with Prime subscription"
4,"I bought this for my 7 year old when her Samsung tablet stopped charging. I love the design. Only problem so far is that it randomly freezes and sometimes the volume button won't respond. Other than that, great for the price.","Great tablet, only problem.."

4,I love my fire! Does all that I need it to and more!!!! However only four stars because I can't get rid of the ads on my lock screen unless I pay $15. it does have a lot of glare but I don't mind the glare too much! Speed is great lots of storage!;,Love my fire
4,"This table is great for social media like facebook, check emails, watch YouTube , and in general good enough for the price!",Great tablet for browsing the internet
4,A little more space on outer edges would be great. I only use it for gaming and have had 1 real problem. At times it kicks me out of the game (popular game from EW) Otherwise great for what I do. Needs more security. But overall good purchase for less than 100$.,Good
4,"For the price you really can't beat this tablet. The picture looks good, amazon has a great game, movie and music catalog. So if your looks big for something just to view movies on, play games or surf the web get this one because for the price it can't be beat!",Great tablet for kids
4,"I wanted something bigger than my phone for reading. I was looking at the kindle fire, and the regular kindle e-readers. I liked the paperwhite and voyager, but they didn't have the ability to play audiobooks. I decided to go with the fire because even though it will be mostly used for reading, I can do many other things with it for a cheaper price.",Good for reading and audio books.
4,love it i got it for my kids its more durable than a apple table,great for kids
4,"I love the product. I'm very happy but I would like even more if the page number was displayed when reading books on this tablet, in case I wanted to refer back to a certain page.",Great product for the money
4,"I had to return my device due to WIFI signal dropping, maybe I just had a bad unit.",Good device
4,"First, I would like to say I own iPads, iPhone, and many things Apple. Second, I also own many android devices. The main reason for this tablet was to take advantage of the lending library that comes Amazon prime. Over all I would purchase this over an iPad mini any day just for the value alone. At first I thought the display wouldn't be up to snuff compared to my iPad, but for movies and reading, it was good enough that it doesn't take away from the experience. However, there are a few annoying ""features"" that are on but can and should be turned off. The ""on-deck"" is a great feature, but I would have liked to have known it was downloading tons of movies in the background, eating up space and bandwidth. A better function would have been to let us choose what to download, instead of getting movies Willynilly. Be sure to turn this off when you get your tablet or it will run slow, and you'll be thinking the tablet is slow. Ok on to kindle for reading. Unfortunately, reading isn't as great as I thought it would be because it doesn't allow scrolling. Works on kindle devices but not on kindle fire devices. If you don't mind flipping the page, then you won't have a problem, but for me, can read much faster by scrolling. One last point, most of the apps aren't as polished under the ""Amazon Store"" as in the Google play store. I know this because I have an Nexus phone and compared them. For example, the Hue app doesn't even work from Amazon Store. Anyway, this point shouldn't deter you from buying it cause there are solutions.",Bought for Kindle Reading and Amazon prime
4,"it would be nice to have full app library, but it does what you need",works great
4,"This gift was for my mother in law. Initially I had to help her set it up, but she loves it and can now program it all by herself. Recommeneded!",Gift for Mother In Law

4,"Purchased the Amazon Fide HD8 as a gift for my dad, who has been overjoyed with it. The display looks great and it offers him access to many of the features he looks for in a tablet, from e-books, streaming video or online shopping.

4,We love our tablets waiting recommend it to my friends,Great tablet
4,I think the amazon fire offer should include a stand/cover as standard. I enjoy mine a lot more since I was forced to purchase a stand/cover which holds the tablet. Would have preferred an instruction sheet to grt everything set up for use.,Amazon fire
4,"Easy to access the apps, but not always easy to quit. The device works good, but since it's the apps that make it what it is, more attention should be given to their operation. I was disappointed that it did not come with even a basic user's guide.","Powerful, but not easy to use"

The only problem I had was that at times it did not seem to be charging well or fast. I took it back to Best Buy and they would have replaced it for me but then would have lost all progress in games I had played. The person at Tech Support suggested that I change the plug in ""brick"". He said that they have had problems with that. I can use the same plug that I use for my iphone and now it charges fine. Glad that it was an easy fix.",great tablet for the price
4,"This is the best tablet you can get for under $100. I have used or own many tablets including Ipad Pro/Mini, Samsung Galaxy Tab and Nexus. They are popular high-end tablets but easily cost over $300 or $400. I was very surprised by quality of this tablet and it gives you much more than what you pay.

I'm happy with the overall product with the exception of two things.1.) the auto brightness control is not good enough for me, its either too bright or too dark. I can't figure out if I'm having issue with the colors or something else.2.) the 2nd issue is not with the tablet itself but after using this for a while i've realized using 8"" tablets for watching movies is not a good experience.",Great tablet for the price paid

It processes rapidly on the web through its Amazon Silk browser. Streaming music also works well. The screen has nice resolution. It does not play well with other operating system apps and the apps available through Amazon does not compare to Google. I was unable to download a Google play app, although G mail works like a champ. The camera does not produce decent images. I wouldn't bother with that function.

4,"Hadn't really checked into Kindles/tablets before. Does more than I expected it too, tho now I'm a little disappointed that it's a little limited to Amazon-related and approved stuff. The app store for the device is more limited even tho it uses a form of Android (which means no Flash also). But I'm mostly using it for reading, so I'm happy with it and would recommend it. The 8 was the perfect size for me, the 6 screen was too small for reading comfortably and the 10 was too big as a handheld.",Good deal
4,I don't know why it takes long to come on and it goes off on me my kids have no problem,Good for a child
4,"Overall I am happy with my Amazon Fire 8 HD. It was easy to take and use on a recent trip, although the Delta app doesn't work with it so that was a little frustrating. Not crazy about seeing the ads that pop up, but for a purchase price of $65 (sale), it's hard to complain. This is my first tablet and I find it to be the perfect size and easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to buy a tablet and expects to use it for reading, surfing the web, playing games and as a lightweight device travel option. I am very happy with the look of the games and everything on the screen, I can see myself using it more at home now, although I will still use my laptop when I want a bigger screen. I bought it in the store & they were out of cases, so I recommend buying a case that also acts as a stand. I found one on Amazon that was inexpensive and came in an array of colors.",First Tablet purchase
4,"Purchased this as a child's tablet and I couldn't be happier! I was buying it thinking that it would be cut-rate but ok for a small child to play with on long car rides and on rainy days. Despite the low cost and unimpressive stats I have been very surprised by the quality. The screen is perfectly adequate for games and kids shows, the parental controls/child profile settings are excellent and the stereo speakers CRUSH the built in speakers on my iPad Air 2. The only drawbacks I have found so far are power related. The battery seems to drain fairly quickly under what I would consider normal use and the included charger (typical usb type) takes a very very long time to fully charge the tablet. I suspect this is the charger's limitation rather than the tablet's and it may charge better with a different power supply.I wish that I had purchased two of these tablets at the price they were for sale and I would have kept the second for my own use when on the road.",Incredible value tablet!
4,"Gave this to my sister-in-law for Mother's Day. Its a great entry level tablet. She loves using it, especially for games.",Great tablet for the price
4,I have the 2015 generation fire and it never worked all that great as far as speed but I enjoyed the feel and the visuals of it. I just purchased the 2016 version and it is remarkably faster than the previous model. Though the newer model doesn't have as nice of a feel and the visuals are not as good. The newer version was much cheaper in price so it explains the feel and visuals. I hope someday they get a model that looks and feels great and is also quick.,Much quicker than previous model
4,I purchased this tablet for my mother-in-law and she loves it.,Great tablet for beginner
4,"I'm not super thrilled with the proprietary OS on this unit, but it does work okay and does what I need it to do. Appearance is very nice, price is very good and I can't complain too much - just wish it were easier (or at least more obvious) to port new apps onto it. For now, it helps me see things that are too small on my phone while I'm traveling. I'm a happy buyer.",Nice unit. Good price.

Finding a case for this model is a challenge - I found on-line, but expensive considering tablet price. Universal cases don't work due to button placement.",Great inexpensive tablet
4,Fast working tablet but very limited on apps. I like it but it was not really for me. Only apps available were from the Amazon app store so many apps that I hoped to use were unavailable. So it is good for limited use.,Great tablet but not for everything

But if your hooked on google play id go with a Samsung tablet.",Awesome Tablet
4,This is my first e-reader. I didn't know about the odd refresh and it took a little while to get used to but I do love how small and light it is and that I do not have to remember to plug it in everyday,Very light
4,"This kindle is awesome. I love the design of it. Nothing software wise that was different than my other kindle but the way it's designed makes it much more comfortable and easier to read. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because of the price. If it were cheaper, this kindle would have been five stars no doubt.",Great kindle
4,"Got me reading again! Love the merlot cover. This one is the smallest of all the kindle products I believe, and that's a big reason I picked. Also the lightest I believe. Battery life is forever.Two negative points are the Amazon logo in the cover, and the fact you can't do inverted text (black background white text).Those 2 points dropped it from 4 to 5 star for me.Still highly recommended.",Excellent product.
4,"I purchased the Kindle Oasis because I was growing increasingly tired of the glare and cumbersome size of reading off my iPad. So the portability is great. And of course, I went for the most expensive, because I wanted the extra battery life. And while the length of time it stays charged is nice, charges very quickly, it's still overpriced. I love the non-glare screen, you can literally read this anywhere. But the wifi connectivity is patchy at best. I have to go upstairs in my home and stand close to the router for the Oasis to connect, this is very annoying. Wouldn't be a big deal if I only read from this one device. But I read from another and picking up where I left off is a pain most times. Non of my issues are really a big deal, but for $300 I don't feel like I should have any issues.",Love the size..
4,"This product may be extremely overpriced, but it also lives up to everything it's promised. It's a lightweight, long-lasting ereader that is much easier on the eyes than an iPad. It is much lighter and more ergonomical than a paperback, and I find myself renting kindle copies of books I already own just to take advantage of the device's convenience.",Expensive but Brilliant
4,"I've been a kindle owner since the early days and when new versions have come out in the past, it was usually a no-brainier to upgrade. The oasis was a little challenging because the price really makes you stop and think if this upgrade is worth it. After a lot of thought, the factor that convinced me to switch was the reappearance of the page turning buttons. I missed them since they vanished with the kindle keyboard! The paper white and the voyage were great devices but I often accidentally changed pages if I accidentally pinched the bezel when carrying the device or even just shifting positions on the couch. The Oasis' buttons have removed that issue and I am delighted! The weight and thinness of the device are also appreciated tho the paper white etc are pretty thin already. The addition of the cover is interesting but after a month's use I think it's pretty clear the cover/battery is there only to boost the very short-lived battery in the kindle itself. ""Months"" of battery life just seems impossible unless you keep the screen at low illumination and only read a few minutes a day. The screen is clear and bright, I can't see any LED issues others have complained about and the interface does seem snappier than older versions. Ultimately the only real justification for buying this kindle is if you miss the page turn buttons and want to pay top dollar for them. Otherwise, the existing kindles will meet your needs.","Great design, average battery life"
4,"I would definitely buy it again, but it does not have the ambient light sensor like the cheaper voyage does to turn the brightness up and down automatically in the dark or sun. For a product of this price, it shouldn't be missing any features. Otherwise it is great, light, and the text refreshes quickly and is crisp.","Nice, but over priced and missing features"
4,"Great for reading in the sunlight. As well as light, and easy on the wrist. Great product, but a little speedy.",Great for reading
4,"Excellent reader night or day, sunshine or shade. Not as full function as earlier kindels",Excellent Reader
4,"There's no doubt that this is the best Kindle device available. The battery life is astonishing, and the design is unique and extremely ergonomic. Holding this in your hand is such a pleasurable experience, it fits like a glove. So what are the cons you may ask...For one, the battery life depends on the provided case. It acts like a travel charger in a sense. Why a con? Well, it limits your customization options. And there's no way to purchase other colors or replacements for it at this time. So, you best be cautious with it.And two, the price obviously! But if you take into account that you basically are given a premium case, the device itself is a premium device, and you have a traveling charge inside the case...It may almost even out. But a $290-$350 device is hard to justify when it's just for reading.Still would recommend to any fan of e-readers/reading",AMAZING....But at a cost!
4,"I got oasis yesterday, very lighweight compared to voyager, screen size comparable, like having actual page turn button, touchscreen seems kinda slow, the on/off button on top is improvement from back of voyager. cover does seem kind of flimsy, but supposed to be leather so will see how it holds up. finding it easier to hold with cover on, then removed. cover doesn't have separate charge port, so all charging is done thru kindle.",Voyager replacement
4,"Would give it a 5 star if the battery lasted as long as they claim. But it's worth the extra charging times for the nice design. So light and easy in your hand especially without the cover. But, using the cover is comfortable as well. The leather cover smells a bit when it arrives but I let it air out for a few days before using it and now it's fine. Nice quality leather and I love the merlot color. The page turn buttons are easier to use than the buttons on the voyage. Screen looks the same even though they claim there are more backlights on this one. I'm very happy with my Oasis.",Love the Oasis
4,Easy to handle. Light weight. I like that it automatically shuts off when the cover is closed.,Good reader but expensive
4,I love the snap on cover that charges the kindle. It is also very light.,Best Kindle for a price
4,"I was so looking forward to this that I bought it right when it popped up as available on Best Buy. This is obviously the most refined Kindle on the market as of now. The ergonomics are just perfect, as there is no other Kindle or any ebook reader for that matter that is as easy to use single handed as this one. Fits perfectly in the palm and the page turn buttons are a joy to use.The charging case can be removed while reading and it snaps back easily, you do not have to deliberately align it properly. Once the case is connected it starts charging the Kindle which prolongs its battery life.In short, if you are an avid reader and can spare $290, this is the Kindle to buy. For occasional readers it might not make sense to spend so much and the Kindle Paperwhite should do just fine.","Fantastic, if you can afford it"
4,"Finally received the Kindle Lighted Leather Cover for the newest version Kindle. It is VERY lightweight and I had to double and triple check the description considering it states this is a leather cover. The front cover is very thin with a medium-weight cardboard feel to it. The leather on the front cover is extremely thin and you can immediately tell the surface will be easily scratched and marred with normal everyday use. The inside of the front cover has a thin microfiber material to protect the screen. The back cover is hollowed out plastic to form-fit your Kindle and snaps in with relative ease.Using the enclosed graphic instruction card, I removed the Kindle as shown, having to use just enough pressure to make me a bit concerned for someone who would place and remove their Kindle in this cover frequently. However, I plan on using this cover as a full-time solution for both protection and as a light source.I went ahead and pulled up a book and switched the light on, heading to a closet to see how this looked in complete darkness. The light pulls out of the back cover and is nice and stiff and has a locked full-out position. The spread of the light is greater on top obviously but it does reach the entire screen on the Kindle. There was no glare or reflection and I was able to easily read the page without any noticeable straining.If I were to choose between this design and the Kindle Keyboard lighted cover, which I have used since its release, I would choose this newer cover.Read more","Lightweight, good viewing area. 1,"
4,"I purchased this Kindle case in the Saddle Tan color. The leather is high quality (it has that wonderful new smell as well) and has beautiful stitching around the border on the front. The case does not add any bulk to the Kindle. I find it quite comfortable to hold in one hand or two, as the front cover folds behind the case, and I truly feel like I am holding an actual book while reading.At the top of the case, there is a plastic arm that pulls upward to reveal a light, which illuminates the screen of the Kindle perfectly in a dark room. My eyes have no trouble reading with the light activated. The light is powered by the Kindle itself, by way of two metal prongs inside the case making contact with two metal tabs on the lower back of the Kindle. The arm for the light does seem a bit delicate, and I could see a young child inadvertently breaking this if care is not shown. I fear that over time, this will be the first piece to stop functioning as the case is regularly used.My only criticism of this case is that there is no way to secure the front cover from opening. It would have been nice to include a clasp, or some kind of stretchable band to keep the case closed. I paid 54 for this case, which is almost as expensive as the Kindle itself. At that price, the designers should have had the forethought to include a means of securing the case from opening. Aside from this potential problem, this Kindle case is perfect, and adds a bit of sophistication to an already awesome device.Kudos, Amazon!",High Quality Case For Your Kindle
4,"I have had the Kindle Keyboard with it's lighted cover and now I have the new Kindle with lighted cover. I will briefly compare them and then list the pros and cons of this cover.In comparison:-The kindle keyboard in the cover is much heavier than the new kindle in it's cover. The new case does a much better job of securing the kindle as well, it is no longer hinged only on one edge, but instead it is form fit inside of a rigid rubber shell that attaches to the back of the new kindle-The lighting is about the same between both cases, but where the old case lit the screen from the top right corner, the new case lights the screen from the top middle.-I feel like the old light mechanism was more durable. The light bar on this cover is made out of very stiff, thin plastic instead of the thick rubbery plastic that contained the light on the old cover. It also hinges open instead of pulling out of the case, and the hinge feels subpar.-The light on the new case is less angled and tends to get in my eyes more when reading than the old kindle keyboard case did.All in all I still like the new case. It fits the new kindle very well and does not increase the size or weight very much. The leather is somewhat thin but not horribly so and it looks sleek on the kindle. I will be keeping this case.Pros:Compact case that looks very sleekTight and secure fitUses the Kindle's batteries so no additional power is needed.Provides adequate lighting across the entire screen.Cons:Lightbar hinge seems very cheap.Since I only received this today, I cannot yet evaluate the additional drain that this case will place on the Kindle's battery.Read more",I recieved it today!
4,Pretty decent tablet. Good for mindless games and Netflix. You get what you pay for.,Good basic tablet
4,"I was going to have to be face down after eye surgery recently and decided to get a tablet to be able to look at the internet and movies on something other than my phone. While there are ones which have more features (and better software), the Fire HD8 had a good price and was available. It had gotten good reviews, and it performs well, with great battery life. If you're looking for a good, basic tablet, this is a nice option.","Good tablet. Not great, but good."
4,I couldn't get the tablet to work with my WiFi so I returned it and bought a Samsung A-8.,Returned
4,"This tablet is small, compact and easy to handle. It's easy to figure out the main functions. My one complaint is that it does not support some big apps such as Dropbox or Google Drive.",Easy to use and handle
4,"I'm a Windows person & this is not Windows. I'm still learning. I am happy with the size as it fits easily in to my purse, but I HATE touch items - I always seem to touch the wrong area (like spelling something, I go for a letter & get one of the letters next to - so it slows down my typing - one of the reasons I don't have a smartphone). All in all it's pretty good. I guess I would recommend it because it's the way this world is turning. However, they don't make a glass protective screen cover - only plastic.",Does the job
4,Have been using this for a while and never believe it would be so handy and helpful. Product features are good and is quite handy to carry anywhere.,Nice product
4,"This is my first Fire Kindle. I love it. It is fast, and has good internet. It gives me quick access to all my Kindle library. I found out it's easier to scroll through the pages than when using Kindle Touch.",Nice Amazon tablet
4,"I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of ""back"" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the ""X"" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of ""new items."" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under ""new items"" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the ""home"" menu. It's the ""recent"" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's ""On Deck"" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the ""on deck"" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you.",Great price on an awesome little tablet

It uses their version of the Android OS which they call the Fire OS which is decently responsive and fairly intuitive to use - Be aware that you cannot install or run most apps purchased from the Google Play store, but must rely on Amazon's own app store which is decent, but not as extensive as either Apple's or Google's.",Excellent Portable Media Device / Backup Tablet

4,"I like this e reader, but wish the screen were higher resolution. It requires decent light to look good, but it is easy on my eyes.

4,"I purchased this Kindle for my wife because her Kindle Fire gives off too much glare to use in sunny conditions. Besides being able to use it while riding in the car during daytime, the biggest advantage she found is that it is significantly lighter than the Fire. Since she reads for hours on end that is a big plus. The main drawback is that the graphics aren't as clear with this reader. All in all, it was money well spent.",Great entry level e-reader

But I must admit, I am not at all disappointed with this. Works best with English books, does not work that well with native books. Also, this product is not backlit and does not have any option to increase the screen brightness and I would deduct 1 star for that. You need to install another product called Calibre in your computer to convert books to Kindle readable format (mobi). Kindle can also read PDF, but mobi format is better readable compared to Kindle.",Works Best for Avid Readers

4,"This Kindle is nice and my wife who is an avid reader likes the screen quality but truthfully does not like being ""pigeon-holed"" by Amazon for every book or story. Having to go through them for nearly everything greatly declines from the ease of use of the various functions.

4,"Fought it for a long time, but Kindle is awesome. The newer version with adjustable light is best for me.",Kindle
4,I liked my really old one a bit better. It broke after 5 years suddenly. The screen failed. I had to pay over 20 bucks extra to get rid of the ads to Amazon. I wasn't aware of this when I first bought so it was more expensive than expected.,It's good

Asked for help at service desk and they seemed put out by me.I wanted them to call another best buy to see if they had any.I was willing to hold them with a credit card in order to get them.

4,Great tablet works very good and the price is cheap.,Great product
4,"We bought 2 of these for our kids. First, I couldn't believe the price; they were on sale for $35 but are normally still under $50. I was very leery of getting them 'tablets' because of all the things on the internet. But once I set them up I saw that the Kindle Fire has amazing Parental Controls. I can set the times they can play on them and how long they can use them (even how long on specific things - games, videos, web, etc). Most importantly there is an option that allows them to be on the Web but it's only kid stuff. I also love the fact that I have access to Amazon on any device and can share things from it to both the kids' Fire's. I can also check what they've been doing on them. They can only download things that I share. All these controls made me feel better about buying them and more confident that they are safe. There is something called FreeTime which I believe I have the free version but you can get a cheap subscription and it will give you access to thousands of free books. If you have kids, especially younger ones I would highly suggest the Fire. Also, the price is unbeatable, especially the way kids can damage things :)",Great for kids

4,"We got this for my son foe Christmas. Loves it and keeps him entertained! It is user friendly for him for the most part and sturdy with the case it comes with. The only fault I see with this is in kids account. Before you load anything on to it, there are already tons of apps available to download as you please. I wish there was a way to have just the apps you choose to show up. I do also wish that there was a way to lock the screen, or app that he is playing at the time so little fingers don't get off the app accidently, he is only almost 2 though so I cant complain too much. Other than those two things my son loves it!",Pretty good for little kiddos
4,"There is a lot of bang for you buck in this product. It is not up to par with Apple pads and the high end Samsung pads. Check out the Amazon app store to make sure the app you want to use is available. The screen is adequate, not HD, and outside/full sun hard to read.

But the screen. for its size, is beautiful. There are many games, apps, and books available for free. I LOVE my Kindle Fire. It has wonderful, lean, fast apps for accessing email and Facebook.

Great tablet and features (especially kid mode) but have only one complaint so far.....one of the tablets had a BAD DIGITIZER right from the start and had a horrible time trying to use the tablet. Hence only giving this item a 4 star rating as this issue should NEVER happen right out of the package. However Bestbuy is doing everything to make sure I'm a happy customer by ""price matching"" when the item is available (completely sold out everywhere).

4,One has to keep the price of this in mind. For just $40 you do indeed get a lot. It performs fairly well too for the most part. I didn't notice any lags or anything but the resolution isn't very high/good and it's not the best display if you plan on doing lots of reading. It's just fine for videos though.. The tablet has an overall cheap feel to it but then again have to keep the low price in mind.,Not bad for the price but don't expect quality...

I set it up with her as the user, entered her age and name and now Amazon makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age. Simple to do and she loves the capabilities. I also bought and installed a 64gig SD card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage. For the price I think this tablet is best one out there.

5,"It's a great tablet for the price. Don't expect it to be as fast more expensive ones. It's meant for casual use and it does a great job at that. For the price, you can't beat it. Get a nice large microsd card and you don't have to worry about space. It runs a little slow on certain things if you are multitasking but it's a simple tablet. I've run plenty of 720p videos without fail. It's great for ebooks or other files. Some more elaborate pdfs take a while to load if they have a lol of graphics. Battery life seems good for a small table too.The only real Issue I have is the Amazon App store being limited. It is an offshoot of Android but not all the same apps are available. There is a way around it but I wish they would just allow it access to Google Play or at least offer the same apps.So, it's a nice inexpensive table that works great. For the money, you will love it but don't get upset that is doesn't run as fast as a $500 tablet. That's not its job.",Great little tablet
5,Very easy to use tablet. Lots of apps and game available.,Easy to use
5,"We love the FreeTime settings for kids on the newer Kindle Fires. I was able to create a login for each of our kids as well as myself and set limits to the amount of device time they are allowed daily (can set to more for weekends if desired). You can set the age restrictions for content also, to avoid inappropriate ads, etc. Once you've downloaded apps, you can choose which ones you want each child to have access to in their profile settings, so if one child is older you can allow them access to something their younger siblings shouldn't have. Basically, I like that I can set their access rights and know they're safe so I don't have to continually monitor every moment. By the way, FreeTime kids settings are available without having to subscribe to their FreeTime app access plan. :)",Great tablet for kids!
5,"Great tablet, very clear picture. Would buy again.",Love it!

We can't control what they put on the Internet but we can control what our children watch and download they stay very occupied on educational apps ,read books most of these apps are free to I also recommend NOT putting a payment method option other than that my kids loved it","Great fun,Educational apps,books,brain teasers"

For the price, I thought it would be a good option for her since she doesn't want to drop the cash on an iPad.For comparison, the closest thing I have is an 8"" insignia tablet with similar screen resolution, storage, and features that was released at the same time. The Fire tablet impresses me! It is more responsive than the existing android tablet I have.This tablet runs FireOS which is Amazon's customized version of Android. Typically I do not like custom Android, preferring to have as close to a vanilla system as possible. I am not bothered by that with the Fire. If you need them the parental controls are second to none! The Amazon app store is extensive, although not as extensive as the Google Play store. Still you should be able to find pretty much everything you need there.This is not a flagship device, but performs incredibly for the price.

What I love most is that the tablet doesn't place all apps on the device, but uses the users miro SD card instead for up to 200GB of additional storage for a dizzying amount of storage for more games, apps, books and movies that can be downloaded and enjoyed. It also allows the owner to share the device with family members, delegating each member an account personalized and tailored to that individual. There is even an option to create children's accounts--extra bonus. I am able to mirror the content from the tablet onto my Samsung Smart television. I will definitely consider Amazon first and foremost when making any future tablet purchases. It maintains a charge for a good deal of time, alleviating the need to be near an outlet to enjoy using it. I can charge it in the evening and use it for several hours the next day, sometimes two days. No one will ever create a tablet that is more considerate of the owner/end-user.",Best Decision I Ever Made

I highly recommend this sweet tablet.","Perfect size for daily use, good battery life"
5,This was a BIRTHDAY GIFT for my LITTLE one and she LOVED it!,My LITTLE one LOVE this TABLET
5,"I purchased two of these as Christmas presents for my children. I had been researching child friendly tablets with robust controls to keep them away from undesirable content. I found the 7"" Fire Kids Edition, but after looking over the specs and reviews, I found myself unsure of it. I was mostly interested in the FreeTime application, so I did some research on that and found that it was available on other Fire models also. I came across the new Fire HD8, which had more power, a better screen, and far better battery life at a very affordable price point. I gave them a shot and I'm glad I did.I have the Fire HD8's locked into FreeTime mode, so the only activities that can be done are ones that I approve of, but if I want to, I can pick up either of them and unlock them to access Netflix/Amazon Prime or anything else I desire. I currently have reading goals set up that they must achieve before they are able to access videos or games, and those are limited to X amount of time per day. FreeTime also has a bedtime feature which disables/enables the use of the tablets during designated times, which is amazing.The hardware itself is exceptional. The screen resolution is excellent, it's very responsive, and the battery life is spectacular! They advertise up to 12 hours of battery life, and depending on screen brightness, ours last almost that long regularly. The only con I can think of is that the cameras are sub-par, but that's not what I purchased the tablets for, so it's a non-issue for myself.Some of the reviews I read cited that the internal storage was easily filled with FreeTime content, so I installed 128GB SD cards in them. I also purchased some rugged children's cases for them off of Amazon.This is probably one of the best purchases I have made in a long time. The sound of silent children reading all day is priceless!!!",Excellent Product
5,"I bought this tablet for my sister to replace her kindle. We love it except for the fact it would not connect to ATT internet. I suspect this was an ATT problem.

5,"This Fire HD 8 is my first such device. I find it to be easy to operate and very responsive.The touch screen control takes getting used to as I often click on the wrong close part of the screen and have to go back. The Alexa voice assistant surprised me when she announcedherself over the speaker. (I shut her off since I'm not a fan of conversing with computers).My main complaint is that comes with nothing but a charger and cable. The wordless, pictorialstart up instructions were primitive and vague. There are no instructions on how to use thisdevice; no sample book to test and get familiar with. There is a help function thatfills in some basics of functionality but not thorough enough. The WiFi connectivity is great, using the latest protocol and encryption. It has a simple web browser but web time also seems to be the greatest drain on the battery. The cable can be used toattach to a Windows PC and transfer files (books, music, pictures etc). I would also recommend buying a protective case for if its ever accidently dropped.",A good buy!

5,"For me this tablet is an extremely good value! iPads are beautiful things, and they seem to just work really well all the time. But they are expensive! Same thing with Android tablets. You can get a cheap Android tablet, but then you're left with a cheap tablet...poor quality displays, questionable hardware, limited support. I think Amazon hit the spot with their line of Fire Tablets - this HD8 in particular. It's good quality, has a great display, it's quick and snappy, has great battery life. Also being an Android based operating system, there is flexibility like accessing storage, side loading third party apps, even installing Google Play (for those who begrudge the lack of that feature, it can be done). Much more flexibility than you get with an Apple product, at a much lower price than the industry standard Samsung etc. Coming from using Apple products for so long, this thing is really convincing me that there are really viable options other than Apple, and especially for the price, its a great introduction to a different platform. Not only that, it's genuinely a good product!",Awesome Tablet
